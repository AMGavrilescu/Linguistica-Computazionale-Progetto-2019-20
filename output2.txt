And indeed... indeed...”\r\n\r\n“I tell you what,” cried Raskolnikov, raising himself on his pillow and\r\nfixing his piercing, glittering eyes upon him, “I tell you what.”\r\n\r\n“What?” Luzhin stood still, waiting with a defiant and offended face.', 'I could forgive\r\na great deal in a sick man and a connection, but you... never after\r\nthis...”\r\n\r\n“I am not ill,” cried Raskolnikov.', '“Let me alone--let me alone all of you!” Raskolnikov cried in a frenzy.', '“Do you like street music?” said Raskolnikov, addressing a middle-aged\r\nman standing idly by him.', '“I love to hear singing to a street organ,” said Raskolnikov, and his\r\nmanner seemed strangely out of keeping with the subject--“I like it\r\non cold, dark, damp autumn evenings--they must be damp--when all the\r\npassers-by have pale green, sickly faces, or better still when wet\r\nsnow is falling straight down, when there’s no wind--you know what I\r\nmean?--and the street lamps shine through it...”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know....', 'Excuse me...” muttered the stranger, frightened by the\r\nquestion and Raskolnikov’s strange manner, and he crossed over to the\r\nother side of the street.', '“Isn’t there a man who keeps a booth with his wife at this corner?”\r\n\r\n“All sorts of people keep booths here,” answered the young man, glancing\r\nsuperciliously at Raskolnikov.', 'Which province?”\r\n\r\nThe young man looked at Raskolnikov again.', '“Where is it,” thought Raskolnikov.', 'You profit by everything!” Raskolnikov laughed, “it’s\r\nall right, my dear boy,” he added, slapping Zametov on the shoulder.', 'what a charming boy!” Here Raskolnikov\r\nbroke into a nervous laugh right in Zametov’s face.', 'What of it?”\r\n\r\n“The same old woman,” Raskolnikov went on in the same whisper, not\r\nheeding Zametov’s explanation, “about whom you were talking in the\r\npolice-office, you remember, when I fainted.', 'After his sudden fit of laughter Raskolnikov became\r\nsuddenly thoughtful and melancholy.', 'Oh, yes....” Raskolnikov sipped the glass, put a morsel of\r\nbread in his mouth and, suddenly looking at Zametov, seemed to remember\r\neverything and pulled himself together.', 'I read about it a month ago,”\r\n Raskolnikov answered calmly.', '“I should do it quite differently,” Raskolnikov began.', 'This is how I should behave,” Raskolnikov began, again\r\nbringing his face close to Zametov’s, again staring at him and speaking\r\nin a whisper, so that the latter positively shuddered.', 'There’d\r\nbe no trace.”\r\n\r\n“You are a madman,” said Zametov, and for some reason he too spoke in a\r\nwhisper, and moved away from Raskolnikov, whose eyes were glittering.', 'Do you hear?”\r\n\r\n“It means that I’m sick to death of you all and I want to be alone,”\r\n Raskolnikov answered calmly.', 'Own up at once!”\r\n\r\n“Let me go!” said Raskolnikov and tried to pass him.', 'I’ll pick you up, tie you up in a bundle, carry you\r\nhome under my arm and lock you up!”\r\n\r\n“Listen, Razumihin,” Raskolnikov began quietly, apparently calm--“can’t\r\nyou see that I don’t want your benevolence?', '“Stay,” he\r\nroared, as Raskolnikov was about to move.', 'Stop!” he\r\ncried with redoubled fury, noticing that Raskolnikov was again making\r\na movement--“hear me out!', 'Potchinkov’s\r\nhouse, 47, Babushkin’s flat....”\r\n\r\n“I shall not come, Razumihin.” Raskolnikov turned and walked away.', 'I can’t.” And he ran back to overtake Raskolnikov, but\r\nthere was no trace of him.', 'A woman drowning!” shouted dozens of voices; people\r\nran up, both banks were thronged with spectators, on the bridge people\r\ncrowded about Raskolnikov, pressing up behind him.', 'The police still remained round the woman, someone\r\nmentioned the police station.... Raskolnikov looked on with a strange\r\nsensation of indifference and apathy.', 'They took\r\nno notice of Raskolnikov’s coming in; they were talking.', 'Instead of answering Raskolnikov went into the passage and pulled the\r\nbell.', 'and you ought to come up\r\nwith the porter.”\r\n\r\n“The floors have been washed, will they be painted?” Raskolnikov went\r\non.', '“Very well, come along,” said Raskolnikov indifferently, and going\r\nout first, he went slowly downstairs.', '‘I’ll tell you everything there.’ He wouldn’t leave\r\nus.”\r\n\r\nThe porter looked at Raskolnikov, frowning and perplexed.', '“I am Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, formerly a student, I live in\r\nShil’s house, not far from here, flat Number 14, ask the porter, he\r\nknows me.” Raskolnikov said all this in a lazy, dreamy voice, not\r\nturning round, but looking intently into the darkening street.', '“But what do you want?” the porter shouted again, beginning to get angry\r\nin earnest--“Why are you hanging about?”\r\n\r\n“You funk the police station then?” said Raskolnikov jeeringly.', 'Get along!”\r\n\r\nAnd seizing Raskolnikov by the shoulder he flung him into the street.', 'Just what he wants, you may be sure, but once take him up, you\r\nwon’t get rid of him....

“certainly quite right in laughing so\r\nwittily at our legal forms, he-he!', 'Shall I open the window?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t trouble, please,” cried Raskolnikov and he suddenly broke\r\ninto a laugh.', '“Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow, what is the\r\nmatter with you?”\r\n\r\n“I won’t allow it,” Raskolnikov shouted again.', 'Just think, what could we\r\nsay to them?” Porfiry Petrovitch whispered in horror, bringing his face\r\nclose to Raskolnikov’s.', '“I won’t allow it, I won’t allow it,” Raskolnikov repeated mechanically,\r\nbut he too spoke in a sudden whisper.', '“It will be sure to do you good.”\r\n\r\nPorfiry Petrovitch’s alarm and sympathy were so natural that Raskolnikov\r\nwas silent and began looking at him with wild curiosity.', 'But do sit down, for mercy’s sake, sit\r\ndown!”\r\n\r\n“No, not from me, but I knew he went to you and why he went,”\r\n Raskolnikov answered sharply.', 'You\r\nwere delirious when you did all this!”\r\n\r\nFor a moment Raskolnikov felt everything going round.', '“Yes, I do,” went on Porfiry, touching Raskolnikov’s arm genially, “you\r\nmust take care of your illness.', 'You did not speak like that just now and I cannot be\r\nmistaken!”\r\n\r\n“I am lying?” Porfiry repeated, apparently incensed, but preserving\r\na good-humoured and ironical face, as though he were not in the least\r\nconcerned at Raskolnikov’s opinion of him.', 'He-he-he!”\r\n\r\n“I repeat,” Raskolnikov cried furiously, “that I can’t put up with it!”\r\n\r\n“With what?', 'Don’t dare!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t worry about the form,” Porfiry interrupted with the same sly\r\nsmile, as it were, gloating with enjoyment over Raskolnikov.', '“You are lying,” roared Raskolnikov without restraint, “you lie, you\r\ndamned punchinello!” and he rushed at Porfiry who retreated to the other\r\ndoor, not at all alarmed.', '“Ah, they’re coming,” cried Raskolnikov.', 'I am ready!”\r\n\r\nBut at this moment a strange incident occurred, something so unexpected\r\nthat neither Raskolnikov nor Porfiry Petrovitch could have looked for\r\nsuch a conclusion to their interview.', 'CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nWhen he remembered the scene afterwards, this is how Raskolnikov saw it.', 'Then he looked towards Raskolnikov, who was standing in the corner,\r\nstaring wildly at Nikolay and moved towards him, but stopped short,\r\nlooked from Nikolay to Raskolnikov and then again at Nikolay, and\r\nseeming unable to restrain himself darted at the latter.', '“It’s not his own tale he is\r\ntelling,” he muttered as though to himself, and suddenly his eyes rested\r\non Raskolnikov again.', 'He was apparently so taken up with Nikolay that for a moment he had\r\nforgotten Raskolnikov.', '“I suppose you didn’t expect it?” said Raskolnikov who, though he had\r\nnot yet fully grasped the situation, had regained his courage.', 'He-he!”\r\n\r\n“You’re trembling, too, Porfiry Petrovitch!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I am; I didn’t expect it.”\r\n\r\nThey were already at the door; Porfiry was impatient for Raskolnikov to\r\nbe gone.', '“And your little surprise, aren’t you going to show it to me?”\r\n Raskolnikov said, sarcastically.', 'As he walked through the office, Raskolnikov noticed that many people\r\nwere looking at him.', 'I\r\nlost my temper,” began Raskolnikov, who had so far regained his courage\r\nthat he felt irresistibly inclined to display his coolness.', '“Yes; know each other through and through,” assented Porfiry Petrovitch,\r\nand he screwed up his eyes, looking earnestly at Raskolnikov.', 'Take care of yourself, and get well.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what to wish you,” said Raskolnikov, who had begun to\r\ndescend the stairs, but looked back again.', 'But he had already partly shown his hand, and no one knew\r\nbetter than Raskolnikov how terrible Porfiry’s “lead” had been for\r\nhim.', 'There’s no denying that Raskolnikov had compromised\r\nhimself seriously, but no _facts_ had come to light as yet; there was\r\nnothing positive.', 'The man stood in the doorway, looked at Raskolnikov without speaking,\r\nand took a step forward into the room.', '“What do you want?” asked Raskolnikov, numb with terror.', '“What is it?” cried Raskolnikov.', 'And remembering the address we came here yesterday and asked for\r\nyou....”\r\n\r\n“Who came?” Raskolnikov interrupted, instantly beginning to recollect.', 'We cure and prepare\r\nhides, we take work home... most of all I was vexed....”\r\n\r\nAnd the whole scene of the day before yesterday in the gateway came\r\nclearly before Raskolnikov’s mind;

wrapped him in a dreary solitude from which there\r\nwas no escape.', 'At\r\ntheir last meeting Svidrigaïlov informed Raskolnikov that he had made\r\nan arrangement, and a very satisfactory one, for Katerina Ivanovna’s\r\nchildren; that he had, through certain connections, succeeded in getting\r\nhold of certain personages by whose help the three orphans could be at\r\nonce placed in very suitable institutions; that the money he had settled\r\non them had been of great assistance, as it is much easier to place\r\norphans with some property than destitute ones.', 'Svidrigaïlov\r\nlooked intently at Raskolnikov and suddenly, after a brief pause,\r\ndropping his voice, asked: “But how is it, Rodion Romanovitch; you\r\ndon’t seem yourself?', '“These last two days she hasn’t said a word to me, she hasn’t glanced at\r\nme,” Raskolnikov thought suddenly.', 'The sunlight was bright in the room;\r\nthe incense rose in clouds; the priest read, “Give rest, oh Lord....”\r\n Raskolnikov stayed all through the service.', 'He took a chair\r\nand sat down at the table opposite Raskolnikov.', 'Then... then\r\nshe said that perhaps we should very soon have to part... then she began\r\nwarmly thanking me for something; then she went to her room and locked\r\nherself in.”\r\n\r\n“She got a letter?” Raskolnikov asked thoughtfully.', 'I was frantic on their side!”\r\n\r\n“Tell me, please, from whom did you hear that, and why does it interest\r\nyou so?” Raskolnikov asked with unmistakable agitation.', 'It was from him I heard almost all about it.”\r\n\r\n“From Porfiry?”\r\n\r\n“From Porfiry.”\r\n\r\n“What... what did he say?” Raskolnikov asked in dismay.', 'As soon as Razumihin went out, Raskolnikov got up, turned to the window,\r\nwalked into one corner and then into another, as though forgetting the\r\nsmallness of his room, and sat down again on the sofa.', '(During those days Raskolnikov had often recalled\r\npassages in that scene with Porfiry; he could not bear to let his mind\r\nrest on it.)', 'Just let me have one cigarette.”\r\n\r\n“Sit down, Porfiry Petrovitch, sit down.” Raskolnikov gave his visitor\r\na seat with so pleased and friendly an expression that he would have\r\nmarvelled at himself, if he could have seen it.', '“Speak, speak,” seemed as though it would burst from Raskolnikov’s\r\nheart.', 'Everything is relative, Rodion Romanovitch,\r\neverything is relative!”\r\n\r\n“Why, he’s playing his professional tricks again,” Raskolnikov thought\r\nwith disgust.', 'I owe you an explanation and must give it to you,” he continued with a\r\nslight smile, just patting Raskolnikov’s knee.', 'But almost at the same instant a serious and careworn look came into his\r\nface; to his surprise Raskolnikov saw a touch of sadness in it.', 'and it was quite indecorous.”\r\n\r\n“What is he up to, what does he take me for?” Raskolnikov asked himself\r\nin amazement, raising his head and looking with open eyes on Porfiry.', 'I had great hopes of you at that\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\n“But what are you driving at now?” Raskolnikov muttered at last, asking\r\nthe question without thinking.', 'Razumihin!” cried Porfiry Petrovitch, seeming glad of a question\r\nfrom Raskolnikov, who had till then been silent.', 'I came on purpose to tell you everything and deal\r\nopenly with you.”\r\n\r\n“It was not I murdered her,” Raskolnikov whispered like a frightened\r\nchild caught in the act.', 'Whether you confess it or not is nothing to me now; for myself, I am\r\nconvinced without it.”\r\n\r\n“If so, what did you come for?” Raskolnikov asked irritably.', 'Well, secondly, I’ve come to you\r\nbecause...”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, secondly?” Raskolnikov was listening breathless.', 'And\r\nit’s not for ever, the bondage....”\r\n\r\n“The time will be shortened,” laughed Raskolnikov.', 'But anyway\r\n_you_ shouldn’t be afraid of giving yourself up and confessing.”\r\n\r\n“Ach, hang it!” Raskolnikov whispered with loathing and contempt, as\r\nthough he did not want to speak aloud.', 'It’s more in your interest, believe me.”\r\n\r\n“And what if I run away?” asked Raskolnikov with a strange smile.', '“Porfiry Petrovitch, please don’t take up the notion that I have\r\nconfessed to you to-day,” Raskolnikov pronounced with sullen insistence.', 'Good thoughts and\r\nsound decisions to you!”\r\n\r\nPorfiry went out, stooping and avoiding looking at Raskolnikov.', 'There was another thought which had been continually hovering of late\r\nabout Raskolnikov’s mind, and causing him great uneasiness.', 'Svidrigaïlov\r\nwas silently watching and scrutinising him and, what struck Raskolnikov\r\nat once, seemed to be meaning to get up and slip away unobserved.', 'He took the pipe out of his mouth and was on\r\nthe point of concealing himself, but as he got up and moved back his\r\nchair, he seemed to have become suddenly aware that Raskolnikov had seen\r\nhim, and was watching him.', 'What had passed between them was much the\r\nsame as what happened at their first meeting in Raskolnikov’s room.', '“Come, that’s enough,” Svidrigaïlov stopped her at Raskolnikov’s\r\nentrance.', '“I won’t drink anything,” said Raskolnikov.', '“I was going to see you and looking for you,” Raskolnikov began, “but\r\nI don’t know what made me turn from the Hay Market into the X.', '“I fancy you came to see me before you knew that I was capable of having\r\nwhat you call an opinion of my own,” observed Raskolnikov.', 'Do you\r\nremember?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t remember,” answered Raskolnikov with surprise.', 'It’s nothing really to do with me and I can’t cure you, but, of course,\r\nyou understand me.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know that I am being followed?” asked Raskolnikov, looking\r\ninquisitively at him.', '“Well, then, let us leave me alone,” Raskolnikov muttered, frowning.', '“Have I got to bother myself about you, too, now?” said Raskolnikov\r\nsuddenly, coming with nervous impatience straight to the point.', '“Everyone has his plans,” Raskolnikov answered gloomily and impatiently.', 'I am awfully fond of him.”\r\n\r\n“But what a braggart you are,” Raskolnikov said with some disgust.', 'you told me about it yourself.” Raskolnikov felt more and more\r\nirritated.', 'Svidrigaïlov looked at him attentively and Raskolnikov fancied he caught\r\na flash of spiteful mockery in that look.', 'I can see I am ridiculous myself,” muttered Raskolnikov\r\nangrily.', '“It’s been a pleasure.”\r\n\r\n“I should rather think it must be a pleasure!” cried Raskolnikov,\r\ngetting up.', 'His manner to Raskolnikov had\r\nchanged during the last few minutes, and he was ruder and more sneering\r\nevery moment.', '“From all your half tipsy stories,” Raskolnikov observed harshly, “I am\r\n_positive_ that you have not given up your designs on my sister, but\r\nare pursuing them more actively than ever.', 'Having satisfied himself that Raskolnikov was not\r\nfrightened at his threat, he assumed a mirthful and friendly air.', 'I’ll give you the fare.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not thinking of that at all,” Raskolnikov interrupted with disgust.', 'As concerned his sister, Raskolnikov was convinced\r\nthat Svidrigaïlov would not leave her in peace.', 'But now you won’t come!”\r\n\r\nHe suddenly recalled how, an hour before carrying out his design on\r\nDounia, he had recommended Raskolnikov to trust her to Razumihin’s\r\nkeeping.', '“I suppose I really did say it, as Raskolnikov guessed, to\r\ntease myself.', 'But what a rogue that Raskolnikov is!', 'CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nThe same day, about seven o’clock in the evening, Raskolnikov was on\r\nhis way to his mother’s and sister’s lodging--the lodging in Bakaleyev’s\r\nhouse which Razumihin had found for them.', 'Ah, how muddy you are.”\r\n\r\n“I was in the rain yesterday, mother....” Raskolnikov began.', 'Some post or career for you?”\r\n\r\n“What God sends... only pray for me.” Raskolnikov went to the door, but\r\nshe clutched him and gazed despairingly into his eyes.', '“Enough, mother,” said Raskolnikov, deeply regretting that he had come.', 'Dounia’s gracious image when she had bowed to her so attentively\r\nand respectfully at their first meeting in Raskolnikov’s room had\r\nremained in her mind as one of the fairest visions of her life.', 'Sonia remembered how Svidrigaïlov had said to\r\nher the day before that Raskolnikov had two alternatives--Siberia or...', '“Yes,” said Raskolnikov, smiling.', 'It was the green _drap de dames_ shawl of which\r\nMarmeladov had spoken, “the family shawl.” Raskolnikov thought of that\r\nlooking at it, but he did not ask.', '“There’s no knowing who’s a gentleman and who isn’t nowadays.”\r\n\r\nThese exclamations and remarks checked Raskolnikov, and the words, “I am\r\na murderer,” which were perhaps on the point of dropping from his lips,\r\ndied away.', '“No one in?” Raskolnikov asked, addressing the person at the bureau.', 'Excuse me....”\r\n\r\n     [*] Dostoevsky appears to have forgotten that it is after\r\n     sunset, and that the last time Raskolnikov visited the\r\n     police office at two in the afternoon he was reproached for\r\n     coming too late.--TRANSLATOR.', '“Raskolnikov.”\r\n\r\n“Of course, Raskolnikov.', 'It’s so stuffy here...”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I must go,” muttered Raskolnikov.', 'I came to see Zametov.”\r\n\r\n“I understand, I understand, and it’s a pleasure to see you.”\r\n\r\n“I... am very glad... good-bye,” Raskolnikov smiled.', '“It was I...” began Raskolnikov.', 'In the prison the second-class\r\nconvict Rodion Raskolnikov has been confined for nine months.', 'All this pointed strongly to the conclusion that Raskolnikov was not\r\nquite like an ordinary murderer and robber, but that there was another\r\nelement in the case.', 'Razumihin somehow discovered and\r\nproved that while Raskolnikov was at the university he had helped a poor\r\nconsumptive fellow student and had spent his last penny on supporting\r\nhim for six months, and when this student died, leaving a decrepit\r\nold father whom he had maintained almost from his thirteenth year,\r\nRaskolnikov had got the old man into a hospital and paid for his funeral\r\nwhen he died.', 'Raskolnikov’s landlady bore witness, too, that when they\r\nhad lived in another house at Five Corners, Raskolnikov had rescued two\r\nlittle children from a house on fire and was burnt in doing so.', 'At the very beginning of the trial Raskolnikov’s mother fell ill. Dounia\r\nand Razumihin found it possible to get her out of Petersburg during the\r\ntrial.', 'That evening\r\nRazumihin and she agreed what answers they must make to her mother’s\r\nquestions about Raskolnikov and made up a complete story for her\r\nmother’s benefit of his having to go away to a distant part of Russia\r\non a business commission, which would bring him in the end money and\r\nreputation.', 'Five months after Raskolnikov’s confession, he was sentenced.', 'Not a word\r\npassed between Raskolnikov and her on the subject, but both knew it\r\nwould be so.', 'Apart from the danger of her morbid\r\nexcitement, there was the risk of someone’s recalling Raskolnikov’s name\r\nand speaking of the recent trial.', 'For a long time Raskolnikov did not know of his mother’s death, though\r\na regular correspondence had been maintained from the time he reached\r\nSiberia.', 'Sonia’s letters were full of the most matter-of-fact\r\ndetail, the simplest and clearest description of all Raskolnikov’s\r\nsurroundings as a convict.', 'But she did not mention that the\r\nauthorities were, through her, interested in Raskolnikov; that his task\r\nwas lightened and so on.', 'He was ashamed just\r\nbecause he, Raskolnikov, had so hopelessly, stupidly come to grief\r\nthrough some decree of blind fate, and must humble himself and submit to\r\n“the idiocy” of a sentence, if he were anyhow to be at peace.', 'They simply looked down upon all the rest as\r\nignorant churls; but Raskolnikov could not look upon them like that.', 'One evening, when he was almost well again, Raskolnikov fell asleep.']

no other causes admitted!...”\r\n\r\n“You are wrong there,” cried Porfiry Petrovitch; he was noticeably\r\nanimated and kept laughing as he looked at Razumihin, which made him\r\nmore excited than ever.', '“Nothing is admitted,” Razumihin interrupted with heat.', 'Let’s hear, please, how he will prove it!”\r\n\r\n“He is always humbugging, confound him,” cried Razumihin, jumping up and\r\ngesticulating.', 'I knew nothing about it either!” cried Razumihin.', 'But not because of the\r\ninfluence of environment?” Razumihin inquired with some alarm even.', 'That can’t be right?” Razumihin muttered in\r\nbewilderment.', 'But there\r\ncertainly is and must be a definite law, it cannot be a matter of\r\nchance.”\r\n\r\n“Why, are you both joking?” Razumihin cried at last.', 'And the unconcealed, persistent, nervous, and _discourteous_ sarcasm of\r\nPorfiry seemed strange to Razumihin beside that quiet and mournful face.', 'He said just now (he nodded at Razumihin)\r\nthat I sanction bloodshed.', 'That will be his\r\npunishment--as well as the prison.”\r\n\r\n“But the real geniuses,” asked Razumihin frowning, “those who have\r\nthe right to murder?', 'Yes, by the way,” he cried, seemingly suddenly delighted, “I\r\njust remember, what was I thinking of?” he turned to Razumihin, “you\r\nwere talking my ears off about that Nikolay... of course, I know, I know\r\nvery well,” he turned to Raskolnikov, “that the fellow is innocent, but\r\nwhat is one to do?', 'But\r\npainters... no, I don’t remember that there were any painters, and I\r\ndon’t think that there was a flat open anywhere, no, there wasn’t.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” Razumihin shouted suddenly, as though he had\r\nreflected and realised.', 'I\r\nquite muddled it.”\r\n\r\n“Then you should be more careful,” Razumihin observed grimly.', 'CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe it, I can’t believe it!” repeated Razumihin, trying in\r\nperplexity to refute Raskolnikov’s arguments.', '“Stay!” cried Razumihin, seizing him by the shoulder again.', 'Tell them.”\r\n\r\n“Say what you like, I will come with you.”\r\n\r\n“You, too, want to torture me!” he screamed, with such bitter\r\nirritation, such despair in his eyes that Razumihin’s hands dropped.', 'He heard the hurried footsteps of Razumihin; he closed his eyes and\r\npretended to be asleep.', 'He can have his dinner later.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so,” answered Razumihin.', 'Why was that fool Razumihin abusing the socialists?', 'I am staying very near you.”\r\n\r\nAs he went out, Svidrigaïlov ran up against Razumihin in the doorway.', '“Why, who was that?” asked Razumihin, as soon as they were in the\r\nstreet.', 'Strange to say, till that moment it had never\r\noccurred to him to wonder what Razumihin would think when he knew.', 'Razumihin and Raskolnikov were facing Pulcheria Alexandrovna, Razumihin\r\nwas next to Luzhin and Raskolnikov was beside his sister.', '“I had the pleasure... yesterday,” muttered Pyotr Petrovitch with a\r\nhostile glance sidelong at Razumihin;

['We have three\r\nlittle children and Katerina Ivanovna is at work from morning till\r\nnight; she is scrubbing and cleaning and washing the children, for she’s\r\nbeen used to cleanliness from a child.', 'For,\r\nthough Katerina Ivanovna is full of generous feelings, she is a spirited\r\nlady, irritable and short-tempered....', '‘And why not?’ said Katerina Ivanovna with a jeer,\r\n‘you are something mighty precious to be so careful of!’ But don’t blame\r\nher, don’t blame her, honoured sir, don’t blame her!', 'She was not herself\r\nwhen she spoke, but driven to distraction by her illness and the crying\r\nof the hungry children; and it was said more to wound her than anything\r\nelse.... For that’s Katerina Ivanovna’s character, and when children\r\ncry, even from hunger, she falls to beating them at once.', 'She did not utter a word, she did not even look at her, she\r\nsimply picked up our big green _drap de dames_ shawl (we have a shawl,\r\nmade of _drap de dames_), put it over her head and face and lay down\r\non the bed with her face to the wall; only her little shoulders and her\r\nbody kept shuddering.... And I went on lying there, just as before....\r\nAnd then I saw, young man, I saw Katerina Ivanovna, in the same silence\r\ngo up to Sonia’s little bed; she was on her knees all the evening\r\nkissing Sonia’s feet, and would not get up, and then they both fell\r\nasleep in each other’s arms... together, together... yes... and I... lay\r\ndrunk.”\r\n\r\nMarmeladov stopped short, as though his voice had failed him.', 'For our landlady, Amalia Fyodorovna would not hear of it (though\r\nshe had backed up Darya Frantsovna before) and Mr. Lebeziatnikov too...\r\nhm.... All the trouble between him and Katerina Ivanovna was on Sonia’s\r\naccount.', 'And Sonia comes to us now, mostly after dark; she\r\ncomforts Katerina Ivanovna and gives her all she can.... She has a room\r\nat the Kapernaumovs’ the tailors, she lodges with them; Kapernaumov is\r\na lame man with a cleft palate and all of his numerous family have cleft\r\npalates too.', 'Yes.... As soon as Katerina Ivanovna\r\nand Sonia heard of it, mercy on us, it was as though I stepped into the\r\nkingdom of Heaven.', 'I lay down for a nap after dinner and what do you\r\nthink: though Katerina Ivanovna had quarrelled to the last degree with\r\nour landlady Amalia Fyodorovna only a week before, she could not\r\nresist then asking her in to coffee.', 'Well, then, sir” (Marmeladov suddenly gave a sort\r\nof start, raised his head and gazed intently at his listener) “well, on\r\nthe very next day after all those dreams, that is to say, exactly five\r\ndays ago, in the evening, by a cunning trick, like a thief in the night,\r\nI stole from Katerina Ivanovna the key of her box, took out what was\r\nleft of my earnings, how much it was I have forgotten, and now look\r\nat me, all of you!', 'and\r\nall will understand, Katerina Ivanovna even... she will understand....\r\nLord, Thy kingdom come!” And he sank down on the bench exhausted, and\r\nhelpless, looking at no one, apparently oblivious of his surroundings\r\nand plunged in deep thought.', 'I’m going to Katerina Ivanovna--time I did.”\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov had for some time been wanting to go and he had meant to\r\nhelp him.', '“It’s not Katerina Ivanovna I am afraid of now,” he muttered in\r\nagitation--“and that she will begin pulling my hair.', 'Raskolnikov recognised Katerina Ivanovna at once.', 'Having laid Marmeladov down, Raskolnikov flew to Katerina Ivanovna.', 'He will come to; I’ll pay!”\r\n\r\n“He’s done it this time!” Katerina Ivanovna cried despairingly and she\r\nrushed to her husband.', '“I’ve sent for a doctor,” he kept assuring Katerina Ivanovna, “don’t be\r\nuneasy, I’ll pay.', 'This washing was done by Katerina Ivanovna at night at least twice a\r\nweek, if not oftener.', 'For the family had come to such a pass that they\r\nwere practically without change of linen, and Katerina Ivanovna could\r\nnot endure uncleanliness and, rather than see dirt in the house, she\r\npreferred to wear herself out at night, working beyond her strength when\r\nthe rest were asleep, so as to get the wet linen hung on a line and dry\r\nby the morning.', '“Polenka,” cried Katerina Ivanovna, “run to Sonia, make haste.', 'They\r\nevidently stood in some awe of Katerina Ivanovna.', '“No business to die!” cried Katerina Ivanovna, and she was rushing to\r\nthe door to vent her wrath upon them, but in the doorway came face to\r\nface with Madame Lippevechsel who had only just heard of the accident\r\nand ran in to restore order.', 'I am the landlady!”\r\n\r\n“Amalia Ludwigovna, I beg you to recollect what you are saying,”\r\n Katerina Ivanovna began haughtily (she always took a haughty tone with\r\nthe landlady that she might “remember her place” and even now could not\r\ndeny herself this satisfaction).', 'You may rest assured, Amalia Ludwigovna...”\r\n\r\nAll this was uttered with extreme rapidity, getting quicker and quicker,\r\nbut a cough suddenly cut short Katerina Ivanovna’s eloquence.', '“They’ve gone for him,” Katerina Ivanovna shouted to him, he obeyed her\r\nshout and was silent.', '“What now?” cried Katerina Ivanovna.', '“Be silent,” Katerina Ivanovna cried irritably, “you know why she is\r\nbarefooted.”\r\n\r\n“Thank God, the doctor,” exclaimed Raskolnikov, relieved.', 'The doctor came in, a precise little old man, a German, looking about\r\nhim mistrustfully; he went up to the sick man, took his pulse, carefully\r\nfelt his head and with the help of Katerina Ivanovna he unbuttoned the\r\nblood-stained shirt, and bared the injured man’s chest.', 'The priest stepped back and turned to say a few words of admonition and\r\nconsolation to Katerina Ivanovna on leaving.', '“And isn’t that a sin?” cried Katerina Ivanovna, pointing to the dying\r\nman.', '“Perhaps those who have involuntarily caused the accident will agree to\r\ncompensate you, at least for the loss of his earnings.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t understand!” cried Katerina Ivanovna angrily waving her hand.', 'Marmeladov was in the last agony; he did not take his eyes off the face\r\nof Katerina Ivanovna, who was bending over him again.', 'He kept trying\r\nto say something to her; he began moving his tongue with difficulty and\r\narticulating indistinctly, but Katerina Ivanovna, understanding that he\r\nwanted to ask her forgiveness, called peremptorily to him:\r\n\r\n“Be silent!', 'Lie do-own!” cried Katerina Ivanovna.', '“He’s got what he wanted,” Katerina Ivanovna cried, seeing her husband’s\r\ndead body.', 'What can\r\nI give them to-morrow to eat?”\r\n\r\nRaskolnikov went up to Katerina Ivanovna.', 'From that evening, when I learnt how devoted he was to you\r\nall and how he loved and respected you especially, Katerina Ivanovna,\r\nin spite of his unfortunate weakness, from that evening we became\r\nfriends....', 'You come, no doubt, from Katerina Ivanovna.', '“I come from Katerina Ivanovna, and she had no one to\r\nsend.', 'At first Katerina Ivanovna was unwilling, but now she sees\r\nherself that it’s necessary...”\r\n\r\n“To-day, then?”\r\n\r\n“She begs you to do us the honour to be in the church to-morrow for the\r\nservice, and then to be present at the funeral lunch.”\r\n\r\n“She is giving a funeral lunch?”\r\n\r\n“Yes... just a little....

Good-bye, I will tell Katerina Ivanovna.”\r\n\r\nShe was extremely glad to escape at last; she went away looking down,\r\nhurrying to get out of sight as soon as possible, to walk the twenty\r\nsteps to the turning on the right and to be at last alone, and then\r\nmoving rapidly along, looking at no one, noticing nothing, to think, to\r\nremember, to meditate on every word, every detail.', '“I may perhaps not see you again...”\r\n\r\n“Are you... going away?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know... to-morrow....”\r\n\r\n“Then you are not coming to Katerina Ivanovna to-morrow?” Sonia’s voice\r\nshook.', 'He told me all about you....

mind is\r\nunhinged,” he said after a brief silence.', '“What, what,” he thought, “could hitherto have hindered\r\nher from putting an end to it?” Only then he realised what those poor\r\nlittle orphan children and that pitiful half-crazy Katerina Ivanovna,\r\nknocking her head against the wall in her consumption, meant for Sonia.', 'She jumped up from\r\ntime to time, wept and wrung her hands, then sank again into feverish\r\nsleep and dreamt of Polenka, Katerina Ivanovna and Lizaveta, of reading\r\nthe gospel and him... him with pale face, with burning eyes... kissing\r\nher feet, weeping.', 'He had a sudden sense almost of joy; he\r\nwanted to make haste to Katerina Ivanovna’s.', 'The\r\npreparations for the funeral dinner at Katerina Ivanovna’s excited\r\nhis curiosity as he passed.', 'Inquiring of Madame Lippevechsel who was busy\r\nlaying the table while Katerina Ivanovna was away at the cemetery, he\r\nheard that the entertainment was to be a great affair, that all the\r\nlodgers had been invited, among them some who had not known the dead\r\nman, that even Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov was invited in spite of\r\nhis previous quarrel with Katerina Ivanovna, that he, Pyotr Petrovitch,\r\nwas not only invited, but was eagerly expected as he was the most\r\nimportant of the lodgers.', '“Why, you thrashed Katerina Ivanovna a month ago.', 'She got out of the room at last, agitated and distressed,\r\nand returned to Katerina Ivanovna, overwhelmed with confusion.', 'CHAPTER II\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to explain exactly what could have originated the\r\nidea of that senseless dinner in Katerina Ivanovna’s disordered brain.', 'Possibly Katerina Ivanovna felt obliged to\r\nhonour the memory of the deceased “suitably,” that all the lodgers,\r\nand still more Amalia Ivanovna, might know “that he was in no way their\r\ninferior, and perhaps very much their superior,” and that no one had the\r\nright “to turn up his nose at him.” Perhaps the chief element was that\r\npeculiar “poor man’s pride,” which compels many poor people to spend\r\ntheir last savings on some traditional social ceremony, simply in order\r\nto do “like other people,” and not to “be looked down upon.” It is very\r\nprobable, too, that Katerina Ivanovna longed on this occasion, at\r\nthe moment when she seemed to be abandoned by everyone, to show those\r\n“wretched contemptible lodgers” that she knew “how to do things, how\r\nto entertain” and that she had been brought up “in a genteel, she might\r\nalmost say aristocratic colonel’s family” and had not been meant for\r\nsweeping floors and washing the children’s rags at night.', 'And Katerina Ivanovna was not broken-spirited; she\r\nmight have been killed by circumstance, but her spirit could not have\r\nbeen broken, that is, she could not have been intimidated, her will\r\ncould not be crushed.', 'For every trifle he ran to Katerina\r\nIvanovna, even hunting her out at the bazaar, at every instant called\r\nher “_Pani_.” She was heartily sick of him before the end, though\r\nshe had declared at first that she could not have got on without this\r\n“serviceable and magnanimous man.” It was one of Katerina Ivanovna’s\r\ncharacteristics to paint everyone she met in the most glowing colours.', 'She had undertaken to lay the table,\r\nto provide the linen, crockery, etc., and to cook the dishes in her\r\nkitchen, and Katerina Ivanovna had left it all in her hands and gone\r\nherself to the cemetery.', 'This pride, though justifiable, displeased Katerina Ivanovna for\r\nsome reason: “as though the table could not have been laid except by\r\nAmalia Ivanovna!” She disliked the cap with new ribbons, too.', 'Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, for instance, who might be said to be the most\r\nrespectable of all the lodgers, did not appear, though Katerina Ivanovna\r\nhad the evening before told all the world, that is Amalia Ivanovna,\r\nPolenka, Sonia and the Pole, that he was the most generous,\r\nnoble-hearted man with a large property and vast connections, who had\r\nbeen a friend of her first husband’s, and a guest in her father’s\r\nhouse, and that he had promised to use all his influence to secure her\r\na considerable pension.', 'It must be noted that when Katerina Ivanovna\r\nexalted anyone’s connections and fortune, it was without any ulterior\r\nmotive, quite disinterestedly, for the mere pleasure of adding to\r\nthe consequence of the person praised.', 'He was only asked out of kindness\r\nand because he was sharing the same room with Pyotr Petrovitch and was a\r\nfriend of his, so that it would have been awkward not to invite him.”\r\n\r\nAmong those who failed to appear were “the genteel lady and her\r\nold-maidish daughter,” who had only been lodgers in the house for the\r\nlast fortnight, but had several times complained of the noise and uproar\r\nin Katerina Ivanovna’s room, especially when Marmeladov had come\r\nback drunk.', 'Katerina Ivanovna heard this from Amalia Ivanovna who,\r\nquarrelling with Katerina Ivanovna, and threatening to turn the whole\r\nfamily out of doors, had shouted at her that they “were not worth the\r\nfoot” of the honourable lodgers whom they were disturbing.', 'One of the visitors sat straight down to the table without\r\neven greeting Katerina Ivanovna.', 'Sonia knew that this would comfort Katerina Ivanovna, would flatter her\r\nand gratify her pride.', 'She seemed\r\nabsent-minded, though she kept looking at Katerina Ivanovna, trying\r\nto please her.', 'Neither she nor Katerina Ivanovna had been able to get\r\nmourning; Sonia was wearing dark brown, and Katerina Ivanovna had on her\r\nonly dress, a dark striped cotton one.', 'Listening to\r\nSonia with dignity, Katerina Ivanovna inquired with equal dignity how\r\nPyotr Petrovitch was, then at once whispered almost aloud to\r\nRaskolnikov that it certainly would have been strange for a man of\r\nPyotr Petrovitch’s position and standing to find himself in such\r\n“extraordinary company,” in spite of his devotion to her family and his\r\nold friendship with her father.', 'But as to Pyotr\r\nPetrovitch, I always had confidence in him,” Katerina Ivanovna\r\ncontinued, “and, of course, he is not like...” with an extremely stern\r\nface she addressed Amalia Ivanovna so sharply and loudly that the latter\r\nwas quite disconcerted, “not like your dressed up draggletails whom\r\nmy father would not have taken as cooks into his kitchen, and my late\r\nhusband would have done them honour if he had invited them in the\r\ngoodness of his heart.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he was fond of drink, he was fond of it, he did drink!” cried the\r\ncommissariat clerk, gulping down his twelfth glass of vodka.', '“My late husband certainly had that weakness, and everyone knows\r\nit,” Katerina Ivanovna attacked him at once, “but he was a kind and\r\nhonourable man, who loved and respected his family.', 'He only ate from\r\npoliteness, just tasting the food that Katerina Ivanovna was continually\r\nputting on his plate, to avoid hurting her feelings.', 'But Sonia became more and more anxious and distressed; she,\r\ntoo, foresaw that the dinner would not end peaceably, and saw with\r\nterror Katerina Ivanovna’s growing irritation.', 'She had heard from Amalia Ivanovna that\r\nthe mother was positively offended at the invitation and had asked the\r\nquestion: “How could she let her daughter sit down beside _that young\r\nperson_?” Sonia had a feeling that Katerina Ivanovna had already heard\r\nthis and an insult to Sonia meant more to Katerina Ivanovna than an\r\ninsult to herself, her children, or her father, Sonia knew that\r\nKaterina Ivanovna would not be satisfied now, “till she had shown those\r\ndraggletails that they were both...” To make matters worse someone\r\npassed Sonia, from the other end of the table, a plate with two hearts\r\npierced with an arrow, cut out of black bread.', 'Katerina Ivanovna flushed\r\ncrimson and at once said aloud across the table that the man who sent it\r\nwas “a drunken ass!”\r\n\r\nAmalia Ivanovna was foreseeing something amiss, and at the same time\r\ndeeply wounded by Katerina Ivanovna’s haughtiness, and to restore the\r\ngood-humour of the company and raise herself in their esteem she began,\r\napropos of nothing, telling a story about an acquaintance of hers “Karl\r\nfrom the chemist’s,” who was driving one night in a cab, and that “the\r\ncabman wanted him to kill, and Karl very much begged him not to kill,\r\nand wept and clasped hands, and frightened and from fear pierced his\r\nheart.” Though Katerina Ivanovna smiled, she observed at once that\r\nAmalia Ivanovna ought not to tell anecdotes in Russian; the latter was\r\nstill more offended, and she retorted that her “_Vater aus Berlin_ was a\r\nvery important man, and always went with his hands in pockets.” Katerina\r\nIvanovna could not restrain herself and laughed so much that Amalia\r\nIvanovna lost patience and could scarcely control herself.', '“Listen to the owl!” Katerina Ivanovna whispered at once, her\r\ngood-humour almost restored, “she meant to say he kept his hands in\r\nhis pockets, but she said he put his hands in people’s pockets.', ')”\r\n\r\nRegaining her good-humour, Katerina Ivanovna began at once telling\r\nRaskolnikov that when she had obtained her pension, she intended to open\r\na school for the daughters of gentlemen in her native town T----.', 'It suddenly appeared that\r\nKaterina Ivanovna had in her hands the very certificate of honour of\r\nwhich Marmeladov had spoken to Raskolnikov in the tavern, when he told\r\nhim that Katerina Ivanovna, his wife, had danced the shawl dance\r\nbefore the governor and other great personages on leaving school.', 'This\r\ncertificate of honour was obviously intended now to prove Katerina\r\nIvanovna’s right to open a boarding-school; but she had armed herself\r\nwith it chiefly with the object of overwhelming “those two stuck-up\r\ndraggletails” if they came to the dinner, and proving incontestably\r\nthat Katerina Ivanovna was of the most noble, “she might even say\r\naristocratic family, a colonel’s daughter and was far superior to\r\ncertain adventuresses who have been so much to the fore of late.” The\r\ncertificate of honour immediately passed into the hands of the drunken\r\nguests, and Katerina Ivanovna did not try to retain it, for it actually\r\ncontained the statement _en toutes lettres_, that her father was of the\r\nrank of a major, and also a companion of an order, so that she really\r\nwas almost the daughter of a colonel.', 'Warming up, Katerina Ivanovna proceeded to enlarge on the peaceful and\r\nhappy life they would lead in T----, on the gymnasium teachers whom\r\nshe would engage to give lessons in her boarding-school, one a most\r\nrespectable old Frenchman, one Mangot, who had taught Katerina Ivanovna\r\nherself in old days and was still living in T----, and would no doubt\r\nteach in her school on moderate terms.', 'Though Katerina Ivanovna tried to appear to be disdainfully unaware of\r\nit, she raised her voice and began at once speaking with conviction of\r\nSonia’s undoubted ability to assist her, of “her gentleness, patience,\r\ndevotion, generosity and good education,” tapping Sonia on the cheek and\r\nkissing her warmly twice.', 'Sonia flushed crimson, and Katerina Ivanovna\r\nsuddenly burst into tears, immediately observing that she was “nervous\r\nand silly, that she was too much upset, that it was time to finish, and\r\nas the dinner was over, it was time to hand round the tea.”\r\n\r\nAt that moment, Amalia Ivanovna, deeply aggrieved at taking no part in\r\nthe conversation, and not being listened to, made one last effort,\r\nand with secret misgivings ventured on an exceedingly deep and weighty\r\nobservation, that “in the future boarding-school she would have to pay\r\nparticular attention to _die Wäsche_, and that there certainly must be a\r\ngood _dame_ to look after the linen, and secondly that the young ladies\r\nmust not novels at night read.”\r\n\r\nKaterina Ivanovna, who certainly was upset and very tired, as well as\r\nheartily sick of the dinner, at once cut short Amalia Ivanovna, saying\r\n“she knew nothing about it and was talking nonsense, that it was the\r\nbusiness of the laundry maid, and not of the directress of a high-class\r\nboarding-school to look after _die Wäsche_, and as for novel-reading,\r\nthat was simply rudeness, and she begged her to be silent.” Amalia\r\nIvanovna fired up and getting angry observed that she only “meant her\r\ngood,” and that “she had meant her very good,” and that “it was long\r\nsince she had paid her _gold_ for the lodgings.”\r\n\r\nKaterina Ivanovna at once “set her down,” saying that it was a lie to\r\nsay she wished her good, because only yesterday when her dead husband\r\nwas lying on the table, she had worried her about the lodgings.', 'To this\r\nAmalia Ivanovna very appropriately observed that she had invited those\r\nladies, but “those ladies had not come, because those ladies _are_\r\nladies and cannot come to a lady who is not a lady.” Katerina Ivanovna\r\nat once pointed out to her, that as she was a slut she could not judge\r\nwhat made one really a lady.', 'But this was too much for Katerina Ivanovna, and she at once declared,\r\nso that all could hear, that Amalia Ivanovna probably never had a\r\nfather, but was simply a drunken Petersburg Finn, and had certainly once\r\nbeen a cook and probably something worse.', 'Amalia Ivanovna turned as red\r\nas a lobster and squealed that perhaps Katerina Ivanovna never had a\r\nfather, “but she had a _Vater aus Berlin_ and that he wore a long coat\r\nand always said poof-poof-poof!”\r\n\r\nKaterina Ivanovna observed contemptuously that all knew what her family\r\nwas and that on that very certificate of honour it was stated in print\r\nthat her father was a colonel, while Amalia Ivanovna’s father--if she\r\nreally had one--was probably some Finnish milkman, but that probably she\r\nnever had a father at all, since it was still uncertain whether her name\r\nwas Amalia Ivanovna or Amalia Ludwigovna.', 'At this Amalia Ivanovna, lashed to fury, struck the table with her fist,\r\nand shrieked that she was Amalia Ivanovna, and not Ludwigovna, “that\r\nher _Vater_ was named Johann and that he was a burgomeister, and that\r\nKaterina Ivanovna’s _Vater_ was quite never a burgomeister.” Katerina\r\nIvanovna rose from her chair, and with a stern and apparently calm voice\r\n(though she was pale and her chest was heaving) observed that “if she\r\ndared for one moment to set her contemptible wretch of a father on a\r\nlevel with her papa, she, Katerina Ivanovna, would tear her cap off her\r\nhead and trample it under foot.” Amalia Ivanovna ran about the room,\r\nshouting at the top of her voice, that she was mistress of the house and\r\nthat Katerina Ivanovna should leave the lodgings that minute; then she\r\nrushed for some reason to collect the silver spoons from the table.', 'Sonia\r\nran to restrain Katerina Ivanovna, but when Amalia Ivanovna shouted\r\nsomething about “the yellow ticket,” Katerina Ivanovna pushed Sonia\r\naway, and rushed at the landlady to carry out her threat.', 'You yourself, mademoiselle, probably will not refuse to confirm\r\nmy statement that I invited you through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, solely in\r\norder to discuss with you the hopeless and destitute position of your\r\nrelative, Katerina Ivanovna (whose dinner I was unable to attend),\r\nand the advisability of getting up something of the nature of a\r\nsubscription, lottery or the like, for her benefit.', '“What!” cried Katerina Ivanovna, suddenly realising the position, and\r\nshe rushed at Luzhin.', 'Give me the ten roubles at once--here!”\r\n\r\nAnd snatching the note from Sonia, Katerina Ivanovna crumpled it up and\r\nflung it straight into Luzhin’s face.', 'Idiot!” shrieked Katerina Ivanovna.', 'Search her,\r\nsearch her!”\r\n\r\nAnd Katerina Ivanovna in a frenzy shook Luzhin and dragged him towards\r\nSonia.', 'Let anyone who likes search her!” cried Katerina Ivanovna.', 'D’you see,\r\nd’you see?”\r\n\r\nAnd Katerina Ivanovna turned--or rather snatched--both pockets inside\r\nout.', 'I know nothing about it,” she cried\r\nwith a heartrending wail, and she ran to Katerina Ivanovna, who clasped\r\nher tightly in her arms, as though she would shelter her from all the\r\nworld.', 'The day\r\nbefore yesterday I did not know that he was staying here, in your room,\r\nand that consequently on the very day we quarrelled--the day before\r\nyesterday--he saw me give Katerina Ivanovna some money for the funeral,\r\nas a friend of the late Mr. Marmeladov.', 'He at once wrote a note to\r\nmy mother and informed her that I had given away all my money, not\r\nto Katerina Ivanovna but to Sofya Semyonovna, and referred in a most\r\ncontemptible way to the... character of Sofya Semyonovna, that is,\r\nhinted at the character of my attitude to Sofya Semyonovna.', 'Yesterday evening,\r\nbefore my mother and sister and in his presence, I declared that I had\r\ngiven the money to Katerina Ivanovna for the funeral and not to Sofya\r\nSemyonovna and that I had no acquaintance with Sofya Semyonovna and had\r\nnever seen her before, indeed.', '“Yes, yes, that’s it,” Lebeziatnikov assented gleefully, “that must be\r\nit, for he asked me, as soon as Sofya Semyonovna came into our room,\r\nwhether you were here, whether I had seen you among Katerina Ivanovna’s\r\nguests.', 'Quick march!”\r\n\r\nAnd with these words she began snatching up everything she could lay\r\nher hands on that belonged to Katerina Ivanovna, and throwing it on the\r\nfloor.', 'We will see whether there is\r\njustice on earth!”\r\n\r\nAnd throwing over her head that green shawl which Marmeladov had\r\nmentioned to Raskolnikov, Katerina Ivanovna squeezed her way through the\r\ndisorderly and drunken crowd of lodgers who still filled the room, and,\r\nwailing and tearful, she ran into the street--with a vague intention\r\nof going at once somewhere to find justice.', 'So when he cried as he left Katerina Ivanovna’s, “Well,\r\nSofya Semyonovna, we shall see what you’ll say now!” he was still\r\nsuperficially excited, still vigorous and defiant from his triumph over\r\nLuzhin.', 'I\r\nwanted to go back directly, but I kept thinking that... you would come.”\r\n\r\nHe told her that Amalia Ivanovna was turning them out of their lodging\r\nand that Katerina Ivanovna had run off somewhere “to seek justice.”\r\n\r\n“My God!” cried Sonia, “let’s go at once....”\r\n\r\nAnd she snatched up her cape.', 'Stay a little with me.”\r\n\r\n“But... Katerina Ivanovna?”\r\n\r\n“You won’t lose Katerina Ivanovna, you may be sure, she’ll come to you\r\nherself since she has run out,” he added peevishly.', 'Known, that is, for a fact,\r\nthat they would be the ruin of Katerina Ivanovna and the children and\r\nyourself thrown in--since you don’t count yourself for anything--Polenka\r\ntoo... for she’ll go the same way.', 'Well, if suddenly it all depended on\r\nyour decision whether he or they should go on living, that is whether\r\nLuzhin should go on living and doing wicked things, or Katerina Ivanovna\r\nshould die?', 'The hoarse broken voice of Katerina Ivanovna could\r\nbe heard from the bridge, and it certainly was a strange spectacle\r\nlikely to attract a street crowd.', 'But instead of\r\nrapping on the pan, Katerina Ivanovna began clapping her wasted hands,\r\nwhen she made Lida and Kolya dance and Polenka sing.', 'Where do you lodge?”\r\n\r\n“What, a license?” wailed Katerina Ivanovna.', 'Weeping and wailing, poor Katerina Ivanovna ran after them.', 'They’re being brought back, the\r\nelder one’s got them.... Ah, the naughty imps!”\r\n\r\nWhen they examined Katerina Ivanovna carefully, they saw that she had\r\nnot cut herself against a stone, as Sonia thought, but that the blood\r\nthat stained the pavement red was from her chest.', 'Oh, dear!”\r\n\r\nThanks to the official’s efforts, this plan was adopted, the policeman\r\neven helping to carry Katerina Ivanovna.', 'Meanwhile Katerina Ivanovna had regained her breath.', 'But during the two or three days after Katerina Ivanovna’s death, he\r\nhad two or three times met Svidrigaïlov at Sonia’s lodging, where he\r\nhad gone aimlessly for a moment.', 'At\r\ntheir last meeting Svidrigaïlov informed Raskolnikov that he had made\r\nan arrangement, and a very satisfactory one, for Katerina Ivanovna’s\r\nchildren; that he had, through certain connections, succeeded in getting\r\nhold of certain personages by whose help the three orphans could be at\r\nonce placed in very suitable institutions; that the money he had settled\r\non them had been of great assistance, as it is much easier to place\r\norphans with some property than destitute ones.', 'He remembered that Katerina Ivanovna’s funeral had been fixed for that\r\nday, and was glad that he was not present at it.', 'Ha-ha-ha!”\r\n\r\n“But you have provided for the children of Katerina Ivanovna.', 'It was Katerina Ivanovna’s debt and not\r\nyours, so you ought not to have taken any notice of the German woman.']

Il nome ' Sonia ' appare in queste frasi:

And I went on lying there, just as before....\r\nAnd then I saw, young man, I saw Katerina Ivanovna, in the same silence\r\ngo up to Sonia’s little bed; she was on her knees all the evening\r\nkissing Sonia’s feet, and would not get up, and then they both fell\r\nasleep in each other’s arms... together, together... yes... and I... lay\r\ndrunk.”\r\n\r\nMarmeladov stopped short, as though his voice had failed him.', 'For our landlady, Amalia Fyodorovna would not hear of it (though\r\nshe had backed up Darya Frantsovna before) and Mr. Lebeziatnikov too...\r\nhm.... All the trouble between him and Katerina Ivanovna was on Sonia’s\r\naccount.', 'At first he was for making up to Sonia himself and then all of\r\na sudden he stood on his dignity: ‘how,’ said he, ‘can a highly educated\r\nman like me live in the same rooms with a girl like that?’ And Katerina\r\nIvanovna would not let it pass, she stood up for her... and so that’s\r\nhow it happened.', 'And Sonia comes to us now, mostly after dark; she\r\ncomforts Katerina Ivanovna and gives her all she can....

Hm... yes... very poor\r\npeople and all with cleft palates... yes.', 'Yes.... As soon as Katerina Ivanovna\r\nand Sonia heard of it, mercy on us, it was as though I stepped into the\r\nkingdom of Heaven.', 'But a minute\r\nlater his face suddenly changed and with a certain assumed slyness and\r\naffectation of bravado, he glanced at Raskolnikov, laughed and said:\r\n\r\n“This morning I went to see Sonia, I went to ask her for a pick-me-up!', 'I have forgiven thee once.... Thy sins\r\nwhich are many are forgiven thee for thou hast loved much....’ And he\r\nwill forgive my Sonia, He will forgive, I know it...', 'I am frightened of\r\nthe children’s crying, too.... For if Sonia has not taken them food...', '“What a stupid thing I’ve done,” he thought to himself, “they have Sonia\r\nand I want it myself.” But reflecting that it would be impossible to\r\ntake it back now and that in any case he would not have taken it, he\r\ndismissed it with a wave of his hand and went back to his lodging.', 'And maybe Sonia\r\nherself will be bankrupt to-day, for there is always a risk, hunting\r\nbig game... digging for gold... then they would all be without a crust\r\nto-morrow except for my money.', 'Hurrah for Sonia!', 'Why, for his sake we would not shrink even\r\nfrom Sonia’s fate.', 'Sonia, Sonia Marmeladov, the eternal victim so long\r\nas the world lasts.', 'And let me tell you, Dounia, Sonia’s life is no worse than life with\r\nMr. Luzhin.', 'Do you understand that the Luzhin smartness is just the same\r\nthing as Sonia’s and may be worse, viler, baser, because in your case,\r\nDounia, it’s a bargain for luxuries, after all, but with Sonia it’s\r\nsimply a question of starvation.', '“Polenka,” cried Katerina Ivanovna, “run to Sonia, make haste.', 'I know what you want to say!” And the sick man\r\nwas silent, but at the same instant his wandering eyes strayed to the\r\ndoorway and he saw Sonia.', '“Who sent you?”\r\n\r\n“Sister Sonia sent me,” answered the girl, smiling still more brightly.', '“I knew it was sister Sonia sent you.”\r\n\r\n“Mamma sent me, too... when sister Sonia was sending me, mamma came up,\r\ntoo, and said ‘Run fast, Polenka.’”\r\n\r\n“Do you love sister Sonia?”\r\n\r\n“I love her more than anyone,” Polenka answered with a peculiar\r\nearnestness, and her smile became graver.', 'First they repeat the ‘Ave Maria’ and then another prayer: ‘Lord,\r\nforgive and bless sister Sonia,’ and then another, ‘Lord, forgive and\r\nbless our second father.’ For our elder father is dead and this is\r\nanother one, but we do pray for the other as well.”\r\n\r\n“Polenka, my name is Rodion.', 'Sit here....”\r\n\r\nAt Sonia’s entrance, Razumihin, who had been sitting on one of\r\nRaskolnikov’s three chairs, close to the door, got up to allow her to\r\nenter.', 'Katerina Ivanovna told me to beg you... to be at the service... in\r\nthe morning... at Mitrofanievsky... and then... to us... to her...\r\nto do her the honour... she told me to beg you...” Sonia stammered and\r\nceased speaking.', '“Mother,” he said, firmly and insistently, “this is Sofya Semyonovna\r\nMarmeladov, the daughter of that unfortunate Mr. Marmeladov, who was run\r\nover yesterday before my eyes, and of whom I was just telling you.”\r\n\r\nPulcheria Alexandrovna glanced at Sonia, and slightly screwed up\r\nher eyes.', 'My mother has just said it is like a tomb.”\r\n\r\n“You gave us everything yesterday,” Sonia said suddenly, in reply, in a\r\nloud rapid whisper; and again she looked down in confusion.', 'There was a light in Dounia’s eyes,\r\nand even Pulcheria Alexandrovna looked kindly at Sonia.', 'Ah, I have said good-bye again.”\r\n\r\nPulcheria Alexandrovna meant to greet Sonia, too; but it somehow failed\r\nto come off, and she went in a flutter out of the room.', 'But Avdotya Romanovna seemed to await her turn, and following her mother\r\nout, gave Sonia an attentive, courteous bow.', '“Come, that’s capital,” he said to Sonia, going back and looking\r\nbrightly at her.', '“Then I will tell Katerina Ivanovna that you are coming,” Sonia said\r\nhurriedly, preparing to depart.', '“Sofya Semyonovna, this is my\r\nfriend Razumihin, and he is a good man.”\r\n\r\n“If you have to go now,” Sonia was beginning, not looking at Razumihin\r\nat all, and still more embarrassed.', 'People are happy who have no need of locks,” he said,\r\nlaughing, to Sonia.', 'At the moment when Razumihin, Raskolnikov, and she stood\r\nstill at parting on the pavement, this gentleman, who was just passing,\r\nstarted on hearing Sonia’s words: “and I asked where Mr. Raskolnikov\r\nlived?” He turned a rapid but attentive look upon all three, especially\r\nupon Raskolnikov, to whom Sonia was speaking; then looked back and noted\r\nthe house.', 'He was waiting for Sonia; he saw that they were parting, and\r\nthat Sonia was going home.', '“I must find\r\nout.”\r\n\r\nAt the turning he crossed over, looked round, and saw Sonia coming the\r\nsame way, noticing nothing.', 'When Sonia came out on the canal bank, they were the only two persons on\r\nthe pavement.', 'On reaching\r\nthe house where she lodged, Sonia turned in at the gate; he followed\r\nher, seeming rather surprised.', 'Only then Sonia noticed him.', '“You lodge at Kapernaumov’s,” he said, looking at Sonia and laughing.', 'How odd!” Sonia looked at him attentively.', 'They give up everything... their eyes\r\nare soft and gentle....

and that made him angry with Dounia.', 'But at last he lost all control and had the face\r\nto make Dounia an open and shameful proposal, promising her all sorts of\r\ninducements and offering, besides, to throw up everything and take her\r\nto another estate of his, or even abroad.', 'To leave her situation at once was impossible not only on\r\naccount of the money debt, but also to spare the feelings of Marfa\r\nPetrovna, whose suspicions would have been aroused: and then Dounia\r\nwould have been the cause of a rupture in the family.', 'And it would\r\nhave meant a terrible scandal for Dounia too; that would have been\r\ninevitable.', 'There were various other reasons owing to which Dounia could\r\nnot hope to escape from that awful house for another six weeks.', 'Marfa\r\nPetrovna accidentally overheard her husband imploring Dounia in the\r\ngarden, and, putting quite a wrong interpretation on the position, threw\r\nthe blame upon her, believing her to be the cause of it all.', 'An awful\r\nscene took place between them on the spot in the garden; Marfa Petrovna\r\nwent so far as to strike Dounia, refused to hear anything and was\r\nshouting at her for a whole hour and then gave orders that Dounia should\r\nbe packed off at once to me in a plain peasant’s cart, into which they\r\nflung all her things, her linen and her clothes, all pell-mell, without\r\nfolding it up and packing it.', 'And a heavy shower of rain came on, too,\r\nand Dounia, insulted and put to shame, had to drive with a peasant in an\r\nopen cart all the seventeen versts into town.', 'You could only perhaps ruin\r\nyourself, and, besides, Dounia would not allow it;

Hm... so it is finally settled; you have\r\ndetermined to marry a sensible business man, Avdotya Romanovna, one\r\nwho has a fortune (has _already_ made his fortune, that is so much\r\nmore solid and impressive), a man who holds two government posts and who\r\nshares the ideas of our most rising generation, as mother writes, and\r\nwho _seems_ to be kind, as Dounia herself observes.', 'And that very Dounia for that very ‘_seems_’ is marrying\r\nhim!', 'Most likely it was partly like that, from\r\nmother’s letter it’s evident: he struck her as rude _a little_, and\r\nmother in her simplicity took her observations to Dounia.', 'And why\r\ndoes she write to me, ‘love Dounia, Rodya, and she loves you more than\r\nherself’?', 'She has her reasons\r\nalready for guessing that she _could not_ live with Dounia after the\r\nmarriage, even for the first few months.', '“Well,... mother I don’t wonder at, it’s like her, God bless her, but\r\nhow could Dounia?', 'Granted\r\nthat he ‘let it slip,’ though he is a sensible man, (yet maybe it\r\nwas not a slip at all, but he meant to make himself clear as soon as\r\npossible) but Dounia, Dounia?', 'No, Dounia was not that sort when I knew\r\nher and... she is still the same, of course!', 'And let me tell you, Dounia, Sonia’s life is no worse than life with\r\nMr. Luzhin.', 'It has to be paid for, it has to be\r\npaid for, Dounia, this smartness.', 'I won’t have your sacrifice, Dounia,\r\nI won’t have it, mother!', 'But what if Dounia were one\r\nof the percentage!', 'See, he is coming to himself, he is\r\nall right again!”\r\n\r\nAnd seizing Dounia by the arm so that he almost dislocated it, he made\r\nher bend down to see that “he is all right again.” The mother and sister\r\nlooked on him with emotion and gratitude, as their Providence.', 'I can’t stand it!”\r\n\r\n“Come, mamma, come out of the room at least for a minute,” Dounia\r\nwhispered in dismay; “we are distressing him, that’s evident.”\r\n\r\n“Mayn’t I look at him after three years?” wept Pulcheria Alexandrovna.', '“Yes... he was so kind... Dounia, I promised Luzhin I’d throw him\r\ndownstairs and told him to go to hell....”\r\n\r\n“Rodya, what are you saying!', '“Good-bye till to-morrow, brother,” said Dounia compassionately--“let us\r\ngo, mother...

Oh,\r\nhow I... hate them all!”\r\n\r\n“In fact,” continued Dounia, “I am marrying Pyotr Petrovitch because of\r\ntwo evils I choose the less.', 'I am not lying,” cried Dounia, losing her composure.', 'I think you said to-day?”\r\n\r\n“Mother, show Rodya Pyotr Petrovitch’s letter,” said Dounia.', 'He\r\ntook it with great interest, but, before opening it, he suddenly looked\r\nwith a sort of wonder at Dounia.', 'Can one resent such an\r\nexpression from Luzhin, as we should if he (he pointed to Razumihin) had\r\nwritten it, or Zossimov, or one of us?”\r\n\r\n“N-no,” answered Dounia, with more animation.', 'So will you... come?”\r\n\r\n“That, of course, is not for me to decide, but for you first, if you are\r\nnot offended by such a request; and secondly, by Dounia, if she, too, is\r\nnot offended.', '“I decided to ask you, Rodya, to urge you not to fail to be with us at\r\nthis interview,” said Dounia.', '“Mother, I am inviting him, too.”\r\n\r\n“Quite right, Dounia.', 'There was a light in Dounia’s eyes,\r\nand even Pulcheria Alexandrovna looked kindly at Sonia.', 'Come, Dounia.... And you, Rodya, had better go for a little\r\nwalk, and then rest and lie down before you come to see us....', 'And will you, Dmitri Prokofitch, do us the favour of dining\r\nwith us?”\r\n\r\n“Please do,” added Dounia.', 'Have you forgotten?” said Dounia, turning\r\nwarmly and awkwardly to him.', 'The whole history of the dead father\r\nfloated before his memory in those moments....\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n“Heavens, Dounia,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna began, as soon as they were in\r\nthe street, “I really feel relieved myself at coming away--more at ease.', '“Do you know, Dounia, I was looking at you two.', 'Surely he can’t be an egoist, Dounia.', '“He won’t be worth much if he does,” answered Dounia, sharply and\r\ncontemptuously.', '“Why, that Sofya Semyonovna, who was there just now.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“I have a presentiment, Dounia.', 'Well, you may believe it or not, but\r\nas soon as she came in, that very minute, I felt that she was the chief\r\ncause of the trouble....”\r\n\r\n“Nothing of the sort!” cried Dounia, in vexation.', 'I am sure that she is a good girl, and that it\r\nis all nonsense.”\r\n\r\n“God grant it may be!”\r\n\r\n“And Pyotr Petrovitch is a contemptible slanderer,” Dounia snapped out,\r\nsuddenly.', 'I was quaking just\r\nnow, for fear mother would ask to look at it, when we spoke of Dounia’s\r\nwatch.', 'They were by now approaching Bakaleyev’s lodgings, where Pulcheria\r\nAlexandrovna and Dounia had been expecting them a long while.', 'This\r\nMarfa Petrovna begged Dounia’s forgiveness afterwards, and she’s just\r\ndied suddenly.', 'He is very strange, and is determined on doing something.... We\r\nmust guard Dounia from him... that’s what I wanted to tell you, do you\r\nhear?”\r\n\r\n“Guard her!', 'Pulcheria Alexandrovna came\r\nforward at once to greet him in the doorway, Dounia was welcoming her\r\nbrother.', 'And Avdotya Romanovna is not over-fatigued\r\neither?”\r\n\r\n“I am young and strong, I don’t get tired, but it was a great strain for\r\nmother,” answered Dounia.', 'here?” Dounia asked in alarm and looked at her mother.', 'won’t he leave Dounia in peace even here?” cried\r\nPulcheria Alexandrovna.', '“Are you speaking the truth when you say that you have good evidence of\r\nthis?” Dounia asked sternly and emphatically.', 'You heard, no doubt, Avdotya Romanovna, when you were\r\nwith them the story of the servant Philip who died of ill treatment he\r\nreceived six years ago, before the abolition of serfdom.”\r\n\r\n“I heard, on the contrary, that this Philip hanged himself.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so, but what drove him, or rather perhaps disposed him,\r\nto suicide was the systematic persecution and severity of Mr.\r\nSvidrigaïlov.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know that,” answered Dounia, dryly.', 'Marfa Petrovna had not the slightest intention of settling anything\r\nsubstantial on him, having regard for his children’s interests, and,\r\nif she left him anything, it would only be the merest sufficiency,\r\nsomething insignificant and ephemeral, which would not last a year for a\r\nman of his habits.”\r\n\r\n“Pyotr Petrovitch, I beg you,” said Dounia, “say no more of Mr.\r\nSvidrigaïlov.', 'He is\r\nparticularly anxious, by the way, Dounia, for an interview with you, at\r\nwhich he asked me to assist.', 'He told me, too, that a week before her death Marfa\r\nPetrovna left you three thousand roubles in her will, Dounia, and that\r\nyou can receive the money very shortly.”\r\n\r\n“Thank God!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, crossing herself.', '“Pray for\r\nher soul, Dounia!”\r\n\r\n“It’s a fact!” broke from Luzhin.', '“Tell us, what more?” Dounia urged Raskolnikov.', '“Then he said that he wasn’t rich and all the estate was left to his\r\nchildren who are now with an aunt, then that he was staying somewhere\r\nnot far from me, but where, I don’t know, I didn’t ask....”\r\n\r\n“But what, what does he want to propose to Dounia?” cried Pulcheria\r\nAlexandrovna in a fright.', '“Don’t go, Pyotr Petrovitch,” said Dounia, “you intended to spend\r\nthe evening.', '“Your request that my brother should not be present at our meeting was\r\ndisregarded solely at my insistance,” said Dounia.', 'There is a line in everything which it is dangerous to overstep;\r\nand when it has been overstepped, there is no return.”\r\n\r\n“That wasn’t what I was speaking of exactly, Pyotr Petrovitch,” Dounia\r\ninterrupted with some impatience.', 'Though I lay claim to the happiness of your hand, I\r\ncannot accept duties incompatible with...”\r\n\r\n“Ah, don’t be so ready to take offence, Pyotr Petrovitch,” Dounia\r\ninterrupted with feeling, “and be the sensible and generous man I have\r\nalways considered, and wish to consider, you to be.', 'I cannot let this pass considering the relationship\r\nand... the obligations existing between us.”\r\n\r\n“What!” cried Dounia, flushing.', 'I don’t know how Rodya repeated them to you, perhaps\r\nhe exaggerated.”\r\n\r\n“He could not have exaggerated them, except at your instigation.”\r\n\r\n“Pyotr Petrovitch,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna declared with dignity, “the\r\nproof that Dounia and I did not take your words in a very bad sense is\r\nthe fact that we are here.”\r\n\r\n“Good, mother,” said Dounia approvingly.', 'I made her sit down to-day\r\nwith mother and Dounia.”\r\n\r\n“Rodya!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.', '“Judging from that remark, we may certainly presume that you were\r\nreckoning on our helplessness,” Dounia observed irritably.', '“I am ashamed, Rodya,” said Dounia.', 'My word is not to be shaken.”\r\n\r\n“What insolence!” cried Dounia, springing up from her seat.', 'Am I to give my Dounia to a man like you?', '“You are a mean and spiteful man!” cried Dounia.', 'When he had bitterly reminded Dounia that he had decided to take her in\r\nspite of evil report, Pyotr Petrovitch had spoken with perfect sincerity\r\nand had, indeed, felt genuinely indignant at such “black ingratitude.”\r\n And yet, when he made Dounia his offer, he was fully aware of the\r\ngroundlessness of all the gossip.', 'The story had been everywhere\r\ncontradicted by Marfa Petrovna, and was by then disbelieved by all the\r\ntownspeople, who were warm in Dounia’a defence.', 'Yet he still thought highly\r\nof his own resolution in lifting Dounia to his level and regarded it as\r\nsomething heroic.', 'In speaking of it to Dounia, he had let out the secret\r\nfeeling he cherished and admired, and he could not understand that\r\nothers should fail to admire it too.', 'He had, in short, a\r\ngreat deal to attend to....\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n“No, I, I am more to blame than anyone!” said Dounia, kissing and\r\nembracing her mother.', 'Only now\r\nand then Dounia turned white and frowned, remembering what had passed.', '“What did Svidrigaïlov say to you?” said Dounia, approaching him.', '“What answer did you give him?” asked Dounia.', 'Where should we be now, Dounia, without this three\r\nthousand!', 'Why, Rodya, this\r\nmorning we had only three roubles in our pocket and Dounia and I were\r\njust planning to pawn her watch, so as to avoid borrowing from that man\r\nuntil he offered help.”\r\n\r\nDounia seemed strangely impressed by Svidrigaïlov’s offer.', '“What do you think, brother?” said Dounia.', '“Where are you going, Rodya?” asked Dounia rather strangely.', 'I meant to tell you, mother,\r\nand you, Dounia, that it would be better for us to part for a time.', '“Wicked, heartless egoist!” cried Dounia.', 'His malice was aimed at himself; with shame and\r\ncontempt he recollected his “cowardice.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nThe morning that followed the fateful interview with Dounia and\r\nher mother brought sobering influences to bear on Pyotr Petrovitch.', 'Is it no use to make another effort?” The thought of Dounia sent a\r\nvoluptuous pang through his heart.', 'It must be noted, by the way, that Pyotr\r\nPetrovitch had during those ten days eagerly accepted the strangest\r\npraise from Andrey Semyonovitch; he had not protested, for instance,\r\nwhen Andrey Semyonovitch belauded him for being ready to contribute to\r\nthe establishment of the new “commune,” or to abstain from christening\r\nhis future children, or to acquiesce if Dounia were to take a lover a\r\nmonth after marriage, and so on.', 'But the “humane” Andrey\r\nSemyonovitch ascribed Pyotr Petrovitch’s ill-humour to his recent breach\r\nwith Dounia and he was burning with impatience to discourse on that\r\ntheme.', 'All at once the door opened and Dounia came in.', '“Don’t be angry, brother; I’ve only come for one minute,” said Dounia.', '“He is competent, hardworking, honest and capable of real love....\r\nGood-bye, Dounia.”\r\n\r\nDounia flushed crimson, then suddenly she took alarm.', 'You’ll go to Dounia,\r\nas well as to Sonia,” he muttered bitterly.', 'The thought of Dounia and\r\nhis mother suddenly reduced him almost to a panic.', 'And... and Dounia\r\nknows,” he thought suddenly.', 'No, I must find out!”\r\n\r\nHe thought of Dounia, realising all he had heard and his heart throbbed,\r\nand he suddenly broke into a run.', 'Svidrigaïlov had\r\nfound out his secret and had had designs on Dounia.', 'And what if, having\r\nlearnt his secret and so having gained power over him, he were to use it\r\nas a weapon against Dounia?', 'To begin with, this would\r\ntransform everything, even his own position; he would have at once to\r\nconfess his secret to Dounia.', 'Would he have to give himself up perhaps\r\nto prevent Dounia from taking some rash step?', 'Will you answer for it that\r\nAvdotya Romanovna regarded me with aversion?”\r\n\r\n“From some words you’ve dropped, I notice that you still have\r\ndesigns--and of course evil ones--on Dounia and mean to carry them out\r\npromptly.”\r\n\r\n“What, have I dropped words like that?” Svidrigaïlov asked in naïve\r\ndismay, taking not the slightest notice of the epithet bestowed on his\r\ndesigns.', 'He had observed Dounia for some time and had\r\nbeen making signs to her.', 'That was what Dounia did.', 'It wasn’t you who told him, of\r\ncourse, but if not you, who then?”\r\n\r\n“Well, we’ve turned the corner now,” Dounia interrupted, “and my brother\r\nwon’t see us.', 'But Dounia did not\r\nnotice this peculiar excitement, she was so irritated by his remark that\r\nshe was frightened of him like a child and that he was so terrible to\r\nher.', 'Unlocking a door leading out of his bedroom, Svidrigaïlov showed Dounia\r\nthe two empty rooms that were to let.', 'He sat down at the opposite side of the table, at least seven\r\nfeet from her, but probably there was the same glow in his eyes which\r\nhad once frightened Dounia so much.', 'Don’t\r\nbe anxious, she won’t betray him.”\r\n\r\n“It cannot be,” muttered Dounia, with white lips.', 'How could he dream of it?” cried Dounia,\r\nand she jumped up from the chair.', 'But where are you going,\r\nAvdotya Romanovna?”\r\n\r\n“I want to see Sofya Semyonovna,” Dounia articulated faintly.', 'I don’t believe you!” cried Dounia,\r\ncompletely losing her head.', 'Open the door at once, at once, base man!”\r\n\r\n“I have lost the key and cannot find it.”\r\n\r\n“This is an outrage,” cried Dounia, turning pale as death.', 'It is very difficult to prove an assault, Avdotya Romanovna.”\r\n\r\n“Scoundrel!” whispered Dounia indignantly.', 'I will wait here.”\r\n\r\nSvidrigaïlov sat down on the sofa about eight steps from Dounia.', 'Do you remember\r\nthat moonlight night, when the nightingale was singing?”\r\n\r\n“That’s a lie,” there was a flash of fury in Dounia’s eyes, “that’s a\r\nlie and a libel!”\r\n\r\n“A lie?', 'He went to Dounia and gently put his arm round her waist.', '“Let me go,” Dounia implored.', '“Here’s the key.”\r\n\r\nHe took it out of the left pocket of his coat and laid it on the table\r\nbehind him, without turning or looking at Dounia.', 'The revolver which Dounia had flung away lay near the door and suddenly\r\ncaught his eye.', 'By degrees Dounia’s image rose before him,\r\nand a shudder ran over him.', 'Again Dounia’s image\r\nrose before him, just as she was when, after shooting the first time,\r\nshe had lowered the revolver in terror and gazed blankly at him, so that\r\nhe might have seized her twice over and she would not have lifted a hand\r\nto defend herself if he had not reminded her.', 'And Dounia, Dounia was all but\r\nbelieving it--what do you say to that?', 'Of course, I am sure that Dounia\r\nhas far too much sense, and besides she loves you and me... but I don’t\r\nknow what it will all lead to.', 'Besides, I shouldn’t believe\r\nanyone, I should refuse to listen.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve come to assure you that I’ve always loved you and I am glad\r\nthat we are alone, even glad Dounia is out,” he went on with the same\r\nimpulse.', 'And Dounia, too; she loves you, she loves you dearly--and Sofya\r\nSemyonovna may come with us if you like.', 'But opening his door he saw Dounia.', '“I feel weak, Dounia, I am very tired; and I should have liked at this\r\nmoment to be able to control myself.”\r\n\r\nHe glanced at her mistrustfully.', 'I don’t know\r\nhow it is, Dounia, I don’t understand it.”\r\n\r\n“Have you been at mother’s?', 'Have you told her?” cried Dounia,\r\nhorror-stricken.', 'I am a contemptible person, Dounia.”\r\n\r\n“A contemptible person, but ready to face suffering!', 'Yes, to escape the disgrace I thought of\r\ndrowning myself, Dounia, but as I looked into the water, I thought that\r\nif I had considered myself strong till now I’d better not be afraid of\r\ndisgrace,” he said, hurrying on.', '“It’s pride, Dounia.”\r\n\r\n“Pride, Rodya.”\r\n\r\nThere was a gleam of fire in his lustreless eyes; he seemed to be glad\r\nto think that he was still proud.', '“Oh, Rodya, hush!” cried Dounia bitterly.', 'He sat with his eyes fixed on the floor; Dounia stood at the\r\nother end of the table and looked at him with anguish.', 'I’ve never, never been stronger\r\nand more convinced than now.”\r\n\r\nThe colour had rushed into his pale exhausted face, but as he uttered\r\nhis last explanation, he happened to meet Dounia’s eyes and he saw such\r\nanguish in them that he could not help being checked.', 'I won’t disgrace you,\r\nyou will see; I’ll still show.... Now good-bye for the present,” he\r\nconcluded hurriedly, noticing again a strange expression in Dounia’s\r\neyes at his last words and promises.', 'For a minute he gazed at the\r\ndelicate expressive face of his betrothed, kissed the portrait and gave\r\nit to Dounia.', 'Don’t be uneasy,” he returned to Dounia, “she was\r\nas much opposed to it as you, and I am glad that she is gone.', 'It was hard for Dounia, but she loved him.', '“I am wicked, I see that,” he thought to himself, feeling ashamed a\r\nmoment later of his angry gesture to Dounia.', 'When she had gone, Sonia began to be tortured by the dread\r\nof his committing suicide, and Dounia too feared it.', 'Why is she looking after me, like my mother or Dounia?', 'At the very beginning of the trial Raskolnikov’s mother fell ill. Dounia\r\nand Razumihin found it possible to get her out of Petersburg during the\r\ntrial.', 'When Dounia returned from her last interview with her brother, she\r\nhad found her mother already ill, in feverish delirium.', 'This was the cause of\r\ngreat uneasiness to Dounia; the idea occurred to her that her mother\r\nsuspected that there was something terrible in her son’s fate and was\r\nafraid to ask, for fear of hearing something still more awful.', 'In any\r\ncase, Dounia saw clearly that her mother was not in full possession of\r\nher faculties.', 'He worried\r\nso much about her that it alarmed Dounia.', 'Two months later Dounia was married to Razumihin.', 'Pulcheria Alexandrovna was delighted to give her blessing to Dounia’s\r\nmarriage with Razumihin; but after the marriage she became even more\r\nmelancholy and anxious.', 'She was\r\ncontinually talking about them, even entering into conversation with\r\nstrangers in the street, though Dounia always accompanied her.', 'But Dounia and her husband could get little comfort out of the news,\r\nespecially at first.']

['“My dear Rodya,” wrote his mother--“it’s two months since I last had a\r\ntalk with you by letter which has distressed me and even kept me\r\nawake at night, thinking.', 'In\r\nthe first place, would you have guessed, dear Rodya, that your sister\r\nhas been living with me for the last six weeks and we shall not be\r\nseparated in the future.', 'This sum (now I can explain it all to you, my precious Rodya) she took\r\nchiefly in order to send you sixty roubles, which you needed so terribly\r\nthen and which you received from us last year.', 'Indeed, dear Rodya, the letter was so nobly and\r\ntouchingly written that I sobbed when I read it and to this day I cannot\r\nread it without tears.', 'You must know, dear Rodya,\r\nthat Dounia has a suitor and that she has already consented to marry\r\nhim.', 'And beware, dear Rodya, when he comes to Petersburg, as he shortly will\r\ndo, beware of judging him too hastily and severely, as your way is, if\r\nthere is anything you do not like in him at first sight.', 'You know\r\nyour sister’s character, Rodya.', 'So, Rodya dear, he may be of the greatest use to you, in\r\nevery way indeed, and Dounia and I have agreed that from this very day\r\nyou could definitely enter upon your career and might consider that\r\nyour future is marked out and assured for you.', 'I am in complete agreement with her, Rodya, and share\r\nall her plans and hopes, and think there is every probability of\r\nrealising them.', 'If possible, I would settle somewhere near you, for the most\r\njoyful piece of news, dear Rodya, I have kept for the end of my letter:\r\nknow then, my dear boy, that we may, perhaps, be all together in a\r\nvery short time and may embrace one another again after a separation of\r\nalmost three years!', 'And now, my precious Rodya,\r\nI embrace you and send you a mother’s blessing till we meet.', 'Love Dounia\r\nyour sister, Rodya; love her as she loves you and understand that she\r\nloves you beyond everything, more than herself.', 'And why\r\ndoes she write to me, ‘love Dounia, Rodya, and she loves you more than\r\nherself’?', 'It’s all Rodya, precious Rodya, her\r\nfirst born!', 'You must know, Rodya, this is the second time\r\nthey have sent from the office; but it was another man last time, and I\r\ntalked to him.', 'Here, Rodya, sit up.', '“I must tell you, Rodya, I dine like this here every day now,” he\r\nmumbled with his mouth full of beef, “and it’s all Pashenka, your dear\r\nlittle landlady, who sees to that; she loves to do anything for me.', 'You see, Rodya, all sorts of things\r\nhave been happening while you have been laid up.', 'Pashenka would never have\r\nthought of doing anything on her own account, she is too retiring; but\r\nthe business man is by no means retiring, and first thing he puts the\r\nquestion, ‘Is there any hope of realising the I O U?’ Answer: there is,\r\nbecause he has a mother who would save her Rodya with her hundred and\r\ntwenty-five roubles pension, if she has to starve herself; and a sister,\r\ntoo, who would go into bondage for his sake.', '“Come, Rodya, my boy, don’t oppose it, afterwards will be too late; and\r\nI shan’t sleep all night, for I bought it by guess, without measure.', 'Guess the price, Rodya, what do you suppose I paid for it,\r\nNastasya!” he said, turning to her, seeing that Raskolnikov did not\r\nspeak.', 'And its being worn really is an\r\nimprovement, it’s softer, smoother.... You see, Rodya, to my thinking,\r\nthe great thing for getting on in the world is always to keep to the\r\nseasons; if you don’t insist on having asparagus in January, you keep\r\nyour money in your purse; and it’s the same with this purchase.', 'And so, Rodya,\r\nyou are set up with a complete new rig-out, for your overcoat will\r\nserve, and even has a style of its own.', 'Pestryakov may be coming\r\nto-night.... By the way, Rodya, you’ve heard about the business already;\r\nit happened before you were ill, the day before you fainted at the\r\npolice office while they were talking about it.”\r\n\r\nZossimov looked curiously at Raskolnikov.', 'I am a comrade of Rodya’s, like him, formerly a student, and now I am\r\nnursing him; so don’t you take any notice of us, but go on with your\r\nbusiness.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you.', 'And if you weren’t a fool, a common\r\nfool, a perfect fool, if you were an original instead of a translation...\r\nyou see, Rodya, I recognise you’re a clever fellow, but you’re a\r\nfool!--and if you weren’t a fool you’d come round to me this evening\r\ninstead of wearing out your boots in the street!', 'Now I understand what it all means and so does\r\nZametov....

and,\r\nas your uncle will frank it, it will cost William nothing.”\r\n\r\n“My uncle!” repeated Fanny, with a frightened look.', 'From this day Fanny grew more comfortable.', 'But I must tell you another\r\nthing of Fanny, so odd and so stupid.', 'As for Fanny’s being\r\nstupid at learning, “she could only say it was very unlucky, but some\r\npeople _were_ stupid, and Fanny must take more pains: she did not know\r\nwhat else was to be done; and, except her being so dull, she must add\r\nshe saw no harm in the poor little thing, and always found her very\r\nhandy and quick in carrying messages, and fetching what she wanted.”\r\n\r\nFanny, with all her faults of ignorance and timidity, was fixed at\r\nMansfield Park, and learning to transfer in its favour much of her\r\nattachment to her former home, grew up there not unhappily among her\r\ncousins.', 'Amid the cares and the complacency which his own children suggested,\r\nSir Thomas did not forget to do what he could for the children of Mrs.\r\nPrice: he assisted her liberally in the education and disposal of her\r\nsons as they became old enough for a determinate pursuit; and Fanny,\r\nthough almost totally separated from her family, was sensible of the\r\ntruest satisfaction in hearing of any kindness towards them, or of\r\nanything at all promising in their situation or conduct.', 'CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first event of any importance in the family was the death of Mr.\r\nNorris, which happened when Fanny was about fifteen, and necessarily\r\nintroduced alterations and novelties.', 'The time was now come when Sir Thomas expected his sister-in-law to\r\nclaim her share in their niece, the change in Mrs. Norris’s situation,\r\nand the improvement in Fanny’s age, seeming not merely to do away any\r\nformer objection to their living together, but even to give it the most\r\ndecided eligibility; and as his own circumstances were rendered less\r\nfair than heretofore, by some recent losses on his West India estate,\r\nin addition to his eldest son’s extravagance, it became not undesirable\r\nto himself to be relieved from the expense of her support, and the\r\nobligation of her future provision.', 'In the fullness of his belief that\r\nsuch a thing must be, he mentioned its probability to his wife; and the\r\nfirst time of the subject’s occurring to her again happening to be when\r\nFanny was present, she calmly observed to her, “So, Fanny, you are\r\ngoing to leave us, and live with my sister.', 'But you must come up and tack on my patterns all the same.”\r\n\r\nThe news was as disagreeable to Fanny as it had been unexpected.', 'I suppose you have\r\nhad as little to vex you since you came into this house as any creature\r\nin the world.”\r\n\r\n“I hope I am not ungrateful, aunt,” said Fanny modestly.', 'I am to\r\nleave Mansfield Park, and go to the White House, I suppose, as soon as\r\nshe is removed there.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Fanny, and if the plan were not unpleasant to you, I should call\r\nit an excellent one.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, cousin!”\r\n\r\n“It has everything else in its favour.', 'I hope it does\r\nnot distress you very much, Fanny?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed it does: I cannot like it.', 'My situation, my foolishness and awkwardness.”\r\n\r\n“As to your foolishness and awkwardness, my dear Fanny, believe me, you\r\nnever have a shadow of either, but in using the words so improperly.', 'I do not know any better qualifications for a\r\nfriend and companion.”\r\n\r\n“You are too kind,” said Fanny, colouring at such praise; “how shall I\r\never thank you as I ought, for thinking so well of me.', 'cousin, if I\r\nam to go away, I shall remember your goodness to the last moment of my\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\n“Why, indeed, Fanny, I should hope to be remembered at such a distance\r\nas the White House.', '_Here_, I know, I am of none, and yet I love\r\nthe place so well.”\r\n\r\n“The place, Fanny, is what you will not quit, though you quit the\r\nhouse.', 'how I have trembled at my uncle’s\r\nopening his lips if horses were talked of), and then think of the kind\r\npains you took to reason and persuade me out of my fears, and convince\r\nme that I should like it after a little while, and feel how right you\r\nproved to be, I am inclined to hope you may always prophesy as well.”\r\n\r\n“And I am quite convinced that your being with Mrs. Norris will be as\r\ngood for your mind as riding has been for your health, and as much for\r\nyour ultimate happiness too.”\r\n\r\nSo ended their discourse, which, for any very appropriate service it\r\ncould render Fanny, might as well have been spared, for Mrs. Norris had\r\nnot the smallest intention of taking her.', 'Not all her precautions, however, could save her from\r\nbeing suspected of something better; or, perhaps, her very display of\r\nthe importance of a spare room might have misled Sir Thomas to suppose\r\nit really intended for Fanny.', 'Lady Bertram soon brought the matter to a\r\ncertainty by carelessly observing to Mrs. Norris—\r\n\r\n“I think, sister, we need not keep Miss Lee any longer, when Fanny goes\r\nto live with you.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris almost started.', 'what\r\ncould I do with Fanny?', 'He could not say he _wished_ me to take Fanny.', 'Here am I, a poor desolate widow, deprived of the best\r\nof husbands, my health gone in attending and nursing him, my spirits\r\nstill worse, all my peace in this world destroyed, with hardly enough\r\nto support me in the rank of a gentlewoman, and enable me to live so as\r\nnot to disgrace the memory of the dear departed—what possible comfort\r\ncould I have in taking such a charge upon me as Fanny?', 'Sir Thomas has been writing about it,\r\nI know.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Lady Bertram,” said Mrs. Norris, moving to go, “I can only say\r\nthat my sole desire is to be of use to your family: and so, if Sir\r\nThomas should ever speak again about my taking Fanny, you will be able\r\nto say that my health and spirits put it quite out of the question;\r\nbesides that, I really should not have a bed to give her, for I must\r\nkeep a spare room for a friend.”\r\n\r\nLady Bertram repeated enough of this conversation to her husband to\r\nconvince him how much he had mistaken his sister-in-law’s views; and\r\nshe was from that moment perfectly safe from all expectation, or the\r\nslightest allusion to it from him.', 'He could not but wonder at her\r\nrefusing to do anything for a niece whom she had been so forward to\r\nadopt; but, as she took early care to make him, as well as Lady\r\nBertram, understand that whatever she possessed was designed for their\r\nfamily, he soon grew reconciled to a distinction which, at the same\r\ntime that it was advantageous and complimentary to them, would enable\r\nhim better to provide for Fanny himself.', '“This was so thoughtful and kind!” and would he\r\nonly have smiled upon her, and called her “my dear Fanny,” while he\r\nsaid it, every former frown or cold address might have been forgotten.', 'They took their cheerful rides in the fine mornings of April and May;\r\nand Fanny either sat at home the whole day with one aunt, or walked\r\nbeyond her strength at the instigation of the other: Lady Bertram\r\nholding exercise to be as unnecessary for everybody as it was\r\nunpleasant to herself; and Mrs. Norris, who was walking all day,\r\nthinking everybody ought to walk as much.', 'When he returned,\r\nto understand how Fanny was situated, and perceived its ill effects,\r\nthere seemed with him but one thing to be done; and that “Fanny must\r\nhave a horse” was the resolute declaration with which he opposed\r\nwhatever could be urged by the supineness of his mother, or the economy\r\nof his aunt, to make it appear unimportant.', 'She could not but consider it\r\nas absolutely unnecessary, and even improper, that Fanny should have a\r\nregular lady’s horse of her own, in the style of her cousins.', 'Though Edmund was much more displeased with his aunt than with his\r\nmother, as evincing least regard for her niece, he could not help\r\npaying more attention to what she said; and at length determined on a\r\nmethod of proceeding which would obviate the risk of his father’s\r\nthinking he had done too much, and at the same time procure for Fanny\r\nthe immediate means of exercise, which he could not bear she should be\r\nwithout.', 'The new mare proved a\r\ntreasure; with a very little trouble she became exactly calculated for\r\nthe purpose, and Fanny was then put in almost full possession of her.', 'As the horse continued in name, as well as fact, the property of\r\nEdmund, Mrs. Norris could tolerate its being for Fanny’s use; and had\r\nLady Bertram ever thought about her own objection again, he might have\r\nbeen excused in her eyes for not waiting till Sir Thomas’s return in\r\nSeptember, for when September came Sir Thomas was still abroad, and\r\nwithout any near prospect of finishing his business.', 'Such was the state of affairs in the month of July; and Fanny had just\r\nreached her eighteenth year, when the society of the village received\r\nan addition in the brother and sister of Mrs. Grant, a Mr. and Miss\r\nCrawford, the children of her mother by a second marriage.', 'And Fanny, what was _she_ doing and thinking all this while?', 'Few young ladies of eighteen could\r\nbe less called on to speak their opinion than Fanny.', 'My\r\nmother seldom goes into company herself, and dines nowhere but with\r\nMrs. Grant, and Fanny stays at home with _her_.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!', 'Yours sincerely.’ That is the true manly style;\r\nthat is a complete brother’s letter.”\r\n\r\n“When they are at a distance from all their family,” said Fanny,\r\ncolouring for William’s sake, “they can write long letters.”\r\n\r\n“Miss Price has a brother at sea,” said Edmund, “whose excellence as a\r\ncorrespondent makes her think you too severe upon us.”\r\n\r\n“At sea, has she?', 'CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\n“Well, Fanny, and how do you like Miss Crawford _now_?” said Edmund the\r\nnext day, after thinking some time on the subject himself.', 'I do\r\nnot censure her _opinions_; but there certainly _is_ impropriety in\r\nmaking them public.”\r\n\r\n“Do not you think,” said Fanny, after a little consideration, “that\r\nthis impropriety is a reflection itself upon Mrs. Crawford, as her\r\nniece has been entirely brought up by her?', 'And\r\nwhat right had she to suppose that _you_ would not write long letters\r\nwhen you were absent?”\r\n\r\n“The right of a lively mind, Fanny, seizing whatever may contribute to\r\nits own amusement or that of others; perfectly allowable, when\r\nuntinctured by ill-humour or roughness; and there is not a shadow of\r\neither in the countenance or manner of Miss Crawford: nothing sharp, or\r\nloud, or coarse.', 'I am glad you saw\r\nit all as I did.”\r\n\r\nHaving formed her mind and gained her affections, he had a good chance\r\nof her thinking like him; though at this period, and on this subject,\r\nthere began now to be some danger of dissimilarity, for he was in a\r\nline of admiration of Miss Crawford, which might lead him where Fanny\r\ncould not follow.', 'The mare was only\r\nto be taken down to the Parsonage half an hour before her ride were to\r\nbegin; and Fanny, on its being first proposed, so far from feeling\r\nslighted, was almost over-powered with gratitude that he should be\r\nasking her leave for it.', 'Miss Crawford made her first essay with great credit to herself, and no\r\ninconvenience to Fanny.', 'Edmund, who had taken down the mare and\r\npresided at the whole, returned with it in excellent time, before\r\neither Fanny or the steady old coachman, who always attended her when\r\nshe rode without her cousins, were ready to set forward.', 'At first Miss\r\nCrawford and her companion made the circuit of the field, which was not\r\nsmall, at a foot’s pace; then, at _her_ apparent suggestion, they rose\r\ninto a canter; and to Fanny’s timid nature it was most astonishing to\r\nsee how well she sat.', 'Miss Price, I give way\r\nto you with a very bad grace; but I sincerely hope you will have a\r\npleasant ride, and that I may have nothing but good to hear of this\r\ndear, delightful, beautiful animal.”\r\n\r\nThe old coachman, who had been waiting about with his own horse, now\r\njoining them, Fanny was lifted on hers, and they set off across another\r\npart of the park; her feelings of discomfort not lightened by seeing,\r\nas she looked back, that the others were walking down the hill together\r\nto the village; nor did her attendant do her much good by his comments\r\non Miss Crawford’s great cleverness as a horse-woman, which he had been\r\nwatching with an interest almost equal to her own.', 'I cannot but think that good horsemanship has a\r\ngreat deal to do with the mind.”\r\n\r\nWhen they parted at night Edmund asked Fanny whether she meant to ride\r\nthe next day.', '_She_ rides\r\nonly for pleasure; _you_ for health.”\r\n\r\n“I shall not ride to-morrow, certainly,” said Fanny; “I have been out\r\nvery often lately, and would rather stay at home.', 'You know I am strong\r\nenough now to walk very well.”\r\n\r\nEdmund looked pleased, which must be Fanny’s comfort, and the ride to\r\nMansfield Common took place the next morning: the party included all\r\nthe young people but herself, and was much enjoyed at the time, and\r\ndoubly enjoyed again in the evening discussion.', 'For a few minutes the brother and sister were too eager in\r\ntheir praise of the night and their remarks on the stars, to think\r\nbeyond themselves; but when the first pause came, Edmund, looking\r\naround, said, “But where is Fanny?', '“That is a very foolish trick, Fanny, to be idling away all the evening\r\nupon a sofa.', 'You should learn to think of other people; and, take my word for it, it\r\nis a shocking trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a\r\nsofa.”\r\n\r\nBefore half this was said, Fanny was returned to her seat at the table,\r\nand had taken up her work again; and Julia, who was in high\r\ngood-humour, from the pleasures of the day, did her the justice of\r\nexclaiming, “I must say, ma’am, that Fanny is as little upon the sofa\r\nas anybody in the house.”\r\n\r\n“Fanny,” said Edmund, after looking at her attentively, “I am sure you\r\nhave the headache.”\r\n\r\nShe could not deny it, but said it was not very bad.', 'Even your\r\nmother was out to-day for above an hour.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed, Edmund,” added her ladyship, who had been thoroughly\r\nawakened by Mrs. Norris’s sharp reprimand to Fanny; “I was out above an\r\nhour.', 'I sat three-quarters of an hour in the flower-garden, while Fanny\r\ncut the roses; and very pleasant it was, I assure you, but very hot.', '“I was afraid it would be too much for her,” said Lady Bertram; “but\r\nwhen the roses were gathered, your aunt wished to have them, and then\r\nyou know they must be taken home.”\r\n\r\n“But were there roses enough to oblige her to go twice?”\r\n\r\n“No; but they were to be put into the spare room to dry; and,\r\nunluckily, Fanny forgot to lock the door of the room and bring away the\r\nkey, so she was obliged to go again.”\r\n\r\nEdmund got up and walked about the room, saying, “And could nobody be\r\nemployed on such an errand but Fanny?', 'And as for Fanny’s just stepping down to\r\nmy house for me—it is not much above a quarter of a mile—I cannot think\r\nI was unreasonable to ask it.', 'How often do I pace it three times a day,\r\nearly and late, ay, and in all weathers too, and say nothing about it?”\r\n\r\n“I wish Fanny had half your strength, ma’am.”\r\n\r\n“If Fanny would be more regular in her exercise, she would not be\r\nknocked up so soon.', 'She\r\nwill have a companion in Fanny Price, you know, so it will all do very\r\nwell; and as for Edmund, as he is not here to speak for himself, I will\r\nanswer for his being most happy to join the party.', '“The loss of her ladyship’s company would be\r\na great drawback, and she should have been extremely happy to have seen\r\nthe young lady too, Miss Price, who had never been at Sotherton yet,\r\nand it was a pity she should not see the place.”\r\n\r\n“You are very kind, you are all kindness, my dear madam,” cried Mrs.\r\nNorris; “but as to Fanny, she will have opportunities in plenty of\r\nseeing Sotherton.', 'I cannot do without Fanny.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Rushworth proceeded next, under the conviction that everybody must\r\nbe wanting to see Sotherton, to include Miss Crawford in the\r\ninvitation; and though Mrs. Grant, who had not been at the trouble of\r\nvisiting Mrs. Rushworth, on her coming into the neighbourhood, civilly\r\ndeclined it on her own account, she was glad to secure any pleasure for\r\nher sister; and Mary, properly pressed and persuaded, was not long in\r\naccepting her share of the civility.', 'Probably Miss Crawford will choose the barouche-box\r\nherself.”\r\n\r\n“There can be no objection, then, to Fanny’s going with you; there can\r\nbe no doubt of your having room for her.”\r\n\r\n“Fanny!” repeated Mrs. Norris; “my dear Edmund, there is no idea of her\r\ngoing with us.', 'She\r\nis not expected.”\r\n\r\n“You can have no reason, I imagine, madam,” said he, addressing his\r\nmother, “for wishing Fanny _not_ to be of the party, but as it relates\r\nto yourself, to your own comfort.', 'very glad, if your aunt sees no objection.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris was very ready with the only objection which could\r\nremain—their having positively assured Mrs. Rushworth that Fanny could\r\nnot go, and the very strange appearance there would consequently be in\r\ntaking her, which seemed to her a difficulty quite impossible to be got\r\nover.', 'Mrs. Norris had no affection\r\nfor Fanny, and no wish of procuring her pleasure at any time; but her\r\nopposition to Edmund _now_, arose more from partiality for her own\r\nscheme, because it _was_ her own, than from anything else.', 'When Edmund, therefore, told her in\r\nreply, as he did when she would give him the hearing, that she need not\r\ndistress herself on Mrs. Rushworth’s account, because he had taken the\r\nopportunity, as he walked with her through the hall, of mentioning Miss\r\nPrice as one who would probably be of the party, and had directly\r\nreceived a very sufficient invitation for his cousin, Mrs. Norris was\r\ntoo much vexed to submit with a very good grace, and would only say,\r\n“Very well, very well, just as you chuse, settle it your own way, I am\r\nsure I do not care about it.”\r\n\r\n“It seems very odd,” said Maria, “that you should be staying at home\r\ninstead of Fanny.”\r\n\r\n“I am sure she ought to be very much obliged to you,” added Julia,\r\nhastily leaving the room as she spoke, from a consciousness that she\r\nought to offer to stay at home herself.', 'Their road was through a pleasant country; and Fanny, whose rides had\r\nnever been extensive, was soon beyond her knowledge, and was very happy\r\nin observing all that was new, and admiring all that was pretty.', 'She had none of Fanny’s\r\ndelicacy of taste, of mind, of feeling; she saw Nature, inanimate\r\nNature, with little observation; her attention was all for men and\r\nwomen, her talents for the light and lively.', 'Mrs. Norris was all delight and volubility;\r\nand even Fanny had something to say in admiration, and might be heard\r\nwith complacency.', 'On the present occasion she addressed\r\nherself chiefly to Miss Crawford and Fanny, but there was no comparison\r\nin the willingness of their attention; for Miss Crawford, who had seen\r\nscores of great houses, and cared for none of them, had only the\r\nappearance of civilly listening, while Fanny, to whom everything was\r\nalmost as interesting as it was new, attended with unaffected\r\nearnestness to all that Mrs. Rushworth could relate of the family in\r\nformer times, its rise and grandeur, regal visits and loyal efforts,\r\ndelighted to connect anything with history already known, or warm her\r\nimagination with scenes of the past.', 'The situation of the house excluded the possibility of much prospect\r\nfrom any of the rooms; and while Fanny and some of the others were\r\nattending Mrs. Rushworth, Henry Crawford was looking grave and shaking\r\nhis head at the windows.', 'No banners, cousin, to be ‘blown\r\nby the night wind of heaven.’ No signs that a ‘Scottish monarch sleeps\r\nbelow.’”\r\n\r\n“You forget, Fanny, how lately all this has been built, and for how\r\nconfined a purpose, compared with the old chapels of castles and\r\nmonasteries.', 'Mrs. Rushworth was gone to repeat her lesson to Mr. Crawford; and\r\nEdmund, Fanny, and Miss Crawford remained in a cluster together.', '“It is a pity,” cried Fanny, “that the custom should have been\r\ndiscontinued.', '“It must do the heads\r\nof the family a great deal of good to force all the poor housemaids and\r\nfootmen to leave business and pleasure, and say their prayers here\r\ntwice a day, while they are inventing excuses themselves for staying\r\naway.”\r\n\r\n“_That_ is hardly Fanny’s idea of a family assembling,” said Edmund.', '“If Edmund were but in orders!” cried Julia, and running to where he\r\nstood with Miss Crawford and Fanny: “My dear Edmund, if you were but in\r\norders now, you might perform the ceremony directly.', 'Mr. Crawford was soon followed by Miss Bertram and Mr.\r\nRushworth; and when, after a little time, the others began to form into\r\nparties, these three were found in busy consultation on the terrace by\r\nEdmund, Miss Crawford, and Fanny, who seemed as naturally to unite, and\r\nwho, after a short participation of their regrets and difficulties,\r\nleft them and walked on.', 'The\r\n_manners_ I speak of might rather be called _conduct_, perhaps, the\r\nresult of good principles; the effect, in short, of those doctrines\r\nwhich it is their duty to teach and recommend; and it will, I believe,\r\nbe everywhere found, that as the clergy are, or are not what they ought\r\nto be, so are the rest of the nation.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said Fanny, with gentle earnestness.', 'Fanny made the first\r\ninterruption by saying, “I wonder that I should be tired with only\r\nwalking in this sweet wood; but the next time we come to a seat, if it\r\nis not disagreeable to you, I should be glad to sit down for a little\r\nwhile.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Fanny,” cried Edmund, immediately drawing her arm within his,\r\n“how thoughtless I have been!', 'Perhaps,”\r\nturning to Miss Crawford, “my other companion may do me the honour of\r\ntaking an arm.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, but I am not at all tired.” She took it, however, as she\r\nspoke, and the gratification of having her do so, of feeling such a\r\nconnexion for the first time, made him a little forgetful of Fanny.', '“I am afraid you are very tired, Fanny,” said Edmund, observing her;\r\n“why would not you speak sooner?', 'It is\r\ngenerally allowed to be the greatest bore in the world, and Miss Price\r\nhas found it so, though she did not know it.”\r\n\r\n“I shall soon be rested,” said Fanny; “to sit in the shade on a fine\r\nday, and look upon verdure, is the most perfect refreshment.”\r\n\r\nAfter sitting a little while Miss Crawford was up again.', 'CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour, twenty minutes, passed away, and Fanny was still\r\nthinking of Edmund, Miss Crawford, and herself, without interruption\r\nfrom any one.', '“Miss Price all alone” and “My dear Fanny, how comes this?” were the\r\nfirst salutations.', '“Poor dear Fanny,” cried her\r\ncousin, “how ill you have been used by them!', 'You had better\r\nnot go.”\r\n\r\nHer cousin was safe on the other side while these words were spoken,\r\nand, smiling with all the good-humour of success, she said, “Thank you,\r\nmy dear Fanny, but I and my gown are alive and well, and so good-bye.”\r\n\r\nFanny was again left to her solitude, and with no increase of pleasant\r\nfeelings, for she was sorry for almost all that she had seen and heard,\r\nastonished at Miss Bertram, and angry with Mr. Crawford.', 'It might have been as well, perhaps, if you had\r\nbeen in my place, but you always contrive to keep out of these\r\nscrapes.”\r\n\r\nThis was a most unjust reflection, but Fanny could allow for it, and\r\nlet it pass: Julia was vexed, and her temper was hasty; but she felt\r\nthat it would not last, and therefore, taking no notice, only asked her\r\nif she had not seen Mr. Rushworth.', 'The mother I could not avoid, as long as my tiresome aunt\r\nwas dancing about with the housekeeper, but the son I _can_ get away\r\nfrom.”\r\n\r\nAnd she immediately scrambled across the fence, and walked away, not\r\nattending to Fanny’s last question of whether she had seen anything of\r\nMiss Crawford and Edmund.', 'The sort of dread in which Fanny now sat of\r\nseeing Mr. Rushworth prevented her thinking so much of their continued\r\nabsence, however, as she might have done.', 'I have had walking enough.”\r\n\r\nAnd he sat down with a most gloomy countenance by Fanny.', '“Miss Bertram thought you would follow her.”\r\n\r\n“I should not have had to follow her if she had staid.”\r\n\r\nThis could not be denied, and Fanny was silenced.', 'We did very well without them.”\r\n\r\nA small sigh escaped Fanny here, and she did not know how to contradict\r\nhim.', '“If I had made any difficulty about fetching the key, there might have\r\nbeen some excuse, but I went the very moment she said she wanted it.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing could be more obliging than your manner, I am sure, and I dare\r\nsay you walked as fast as you could; but still it is some distance, you\r\nknow, from this spot to the house, quite into the house; and when\r\npeople are waiting, they are bad judges of time, and every half minute\r\nseems like five.”\r\n\r\nHe got up and walked to the gate again, and “wished he had had the key\r\nabout him at the time.” Fanny thought she discerned in his standing\r\nthere an indication of relenting, which encouraged her to another\r\nattempt, and she said, therefore, “It is a pity you should not join\r\nthem.', 'They were just returned into the wilderness\r\nfrom the park, to which a sidegate, not fastened, had tempted them very\r\nsoon after their leaving her, and they had been across a portion of the\r\npark into the very avenue which Fanny had been hoping the whole morning\r\nto reach at last, and had been sitting down under one of the trees.', 'By their own accounts they had been all walking\r\nafter each other, and the junction which had taken place at last\r\nseemed, to Fanny’s observation, to have been as much too late for\r\nre-establishing harmony, as it confessedly had been for determining on\r\nany alteration.', '“Well, Fanny, this has been a fine day for you, upon my word,” said\r\nMrs. Norris, as they drove through the park.', 'There, Fanny, you shall carry that parcel for me;\r\ntake great care of it: do not let it fall; it is a cream cheese, just\r\nlike the excellent one we had at dinner.', 'Take care of the cheese, Fanny.', 'Mrs. Norris gave the\r\nparticulars of the letters, and the subject was dropt; but after tea,\r\nas Miss Crawford was standing at an open window with Edmund and Fanny\r\nlooking out on a twilight scene, while the Miss Bertrams, Mr.\r\nRushworth, and Henry Crawford were all busy with candles at the\r\npianoforte, she suddenly revived it by turning round towards the group,\r\nand saying, “How happy Mr. Rushworth looks!', 'There is a very good living kept for you, I\r\nunderstand, hereabouts.”\r\n\r\n“Which you suppose has biassed me?”\r\n\r\n“But _that_ I am sure it has not,” cried Fanny.', '“Thank you for your good word, Fanny, but it is more than I would\r\naffirm myself.', 'I have no doubt that I\r\nwas biased, but I think it was blamelessly.”\r\n\r\n“It is the same sort of thing,” said Fanny, after a short pause, “as\r\nfor the son of an admiral to go into the navy, or the son of a general\r\nto be in the army, and nobody sees anything wrong in that.', 'He has met with great kindness from the chaplain of the\r\nAntwerp,” was a tender apostrophe of Fanny’s, very much to the purpose\r\nof her own feelings if not of the conversation.', 'We cannot attempt to\r\ndefend Dr. Grant.”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Fanny, “but we need not give up his profession for all\r\nthat; because, whatever profession Dr. Grant had chosen, he would have\r\ntaken a—not a good temper into it; and as he must, either in the navy\r\nor army, have had a great many more people under his command than he\r\nhas now, I think more would have been made unhappy by him as a sailor\r\nor soldier than as a clergyman.', 'It must make him think;\r\nand I have no doubt that he oftener endeavours to restrain himself than\r\nhe would if he had been anything but a clergyman.”\r\n\r\n“We cannot prove to the contrary, to be sure; but I wish you a better\r\nfate, Miss Price, than to be the wife of a man whose amiableness\r\ndepends upon his own sermons; for though he may preach himself into a\r\ngood-humour every Sunday, it will be bad enough to have him quarrelling\r\nabout green geese from Monday morning till Saturday night.”\r\n\r\n“I think the man who could often quarrel with Fanny,” said Edmund\r\naffectionately, “must be beyond the reach of any sermons.”\r\n\r\nFanny turned farther into the window; and Miss Crawford had only time\r\nto say, in a pleasant manner, “I fancy Miss Price has been more used to\r\ndeserve praise than to hear it”; when, being earnestly invited by the\r\nMiss Bertrams to join in a glee, she tripped off to the instrument,\r\nleaving Edmund looking after her in an ecstasy of admiration of all her\r\nmany virtues, from her obliging manners down to her light and graceful\r\ntread.', 'When I look out on such a night as this, I\r\nfeel as if there could be neither wickedness nor sorrow in the world;\r\nand there certainly would be less of both if the sublimity of Nature\r\nwere more attended to, and people were carried more out of themselves\r\nby contemplating such a scene.”\r\n\r\n“I like to hear your enthusiasm, Fanny.', '“We will stay\r\ntill this is finished, Fanny,” said he, turning his back on the window;\r\nand as it advanced, she had the mortification of seeing him advance\r\ntoo, moving forward by gentle degrees towards the instrument, and when\r\nit ceased, he was close by the singers, among the most urgent in\r\nrequesting to hear the glee again.', 'He has no faults but what a\r\nserious attachment would remove.”\r\n\r\n“If Miss Bertram were not engaged,” said Fanny cautiously, “I could\r\nsometimes almost think that he admired her more than Julia.”\r\n\r\n“Which is, perhaps, more in favour of his liking Julia best, than you,\r\nFanny, may be aware; for I believe it often happens that a man, before\r\nhe has quite made up his own mind, will distinguish the sister or\r\nintimate friend of the woman he is really thinking of more than the\r\nwoman herself.', 'It was Fanny’s first ball, though without the\r\npreparation or splendour of many a young lady’s first ball, being the\r\nthought only of the afternoon, built on the late acquisition of a\r\nviolin player in the servants’ hall, and the possibility of raising\r\nfive couple with the help of Mrs. Grant and a new intimate friend of\r\nMr. Bertram’s just arrived on a visit.', 'It had, however, been a very\r\nhappy one to Fanny through four dances, and she was quite grieved to be\r\nlosing even a quarter of an hour.', 'How she had looked before, Fanny could not recollect, for she\r\nhad been dancing with Edmund herself, and had not thought about her.', 'When he had told of his horse, he took a newspaper\r\nfrom the table, and looking over it, said in a languid way, “If you\r\nwant to dance, Fanny, I will stand up with you.” With more than equal\r\ncivility the offer was declined; she did not wish to dance.', 'A desperate dull life hers must be with the\r\ndoctor,” making a sly face as he spoke towards the chair of the latter,\r\nwho proving, however, to be close at his elbow, made so instantaneous a\r\nchange of expression and subject necessary, as Fanny, in spite of\r\neverything, could hardly help laughing at.', 'Come, Fanny,” taking her hand, “do not be\r\ndawdling any longer, or the dance will be over.”\r\n\r\nFanny was led off very willingly, though it was impossible for her to\r\nfeel much gratitude towards her cousin, or distinguish, as he certainly\r\ndid, between the selfishness of another person and his own.', 'Tom, returning from them into the drawing-room, where Edmund was\r\nstanding thoughtfully by the fire, while Lady Bertram was on the sofa\r\nat a little distance, and Fanny close beside her arranging her work,\r\nthus began as he entered—“Such a horribly vile billiard-table as ours\r\nis not to be met with, I believe, above ground.', 'Lady Bertram, sunk\r\nback in one corner of the sofa, the picture of health, wealth, ease,\r\nand tranquillity, was just falling into a gentle doze, while Fanny was\r\ngetting through the few difficulties of her work for her.', 'Your brother’s taste and your sisters’ seem very different.”\r\n\r\n“I have no hope there, Fanny.', 'I have always protested against comedy, and\r\nthis is comedy in its worst form.” And so saying, she walked hastily\r\nout of the room, leaving awkward feelings to more than one, but\r\nexciting small compassion in any except Fanny, who had been a quiet\r\nauditor of the whole, and who could not think of her as under the\r\nagitations of _jealousy_ without great pity.', 'When this had lasted some time, the division of the party was completed\r\nby Tom Bertram and Mr. Yates walking off together to consult farther in\r\nthe room now beginning to be called _the_ _Theatre_, and Miss Bertram’s\r\nresolving to go down to the Parsonage herself with the offer of Amelia\r\nto Miss Crawford; and Fanny remained alone.', 'Maria blushed in spite of herself as she answered, “I take the part\r\nwhich Lady Ravenshaw was to have done, and” (with a bolder eye) “Miss\r\nCrawford is to be Amelia.”\r\n\r\n“I should not have thought it the sort of play to be so easily filled\r\nup, with _us_,” replied Edmund, turning away to the fire, where sat his\r\nmother, aunt, and Fanny, and seating himself with a look of great\r\nvexation.', '“Sir Thomas\r\nwould not like it.—Fanny, ring the bell; I must have my dinner.—To be\r\nsure, Julia is dressed by this time.”\r\n\r\n“I am convinced, madam,” said Edmund, preventing Fanny, “that Sir\r\nThomas would not like it.”\r\n\r\n“There, my dear, do you hear what Edmund says?”\r\n\r\n“If I were to decline the part,” said Maria, with renewed zeal, “Julia\r\nwould certainly take it.”\r\n\r\n“What!” cried Edmund, “if she knew your reasons!”\r\n\r\n“Oh!', 'The actors may be glad, but the bystanders must be\r\ninfinitely more thankful for a decision; and I do sincerely give you\r\njoy, madam, as well as Mrs. Norris, and everybody else who is in the\r\nsame predicament,” glancing half fearfully, half slyly, beyond Fanny to\r\nEdmund.', 'You must be\r\nCottager’s wife.”\r\n\r\n“Me!” cried Fanny, sitting down again with a most frightened look.', 'I have forty-two to\r\nlearn.”\r\n\r\n“It is not that I am afraid of learning by heart,” said Fanny, shocked\r\nto find herself at that moment the only speaker in the room, and to\r\nfeel that almost every eye was upon her; “but I really cannot act.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, you can act well enough for _us_.', 'You must\r\nget a brown gown, and a white apron, and a mob cap, and we must make\r\nyou a few wrinkles, and a little of the crowsfoot at the corner of your\r\neyes, and you will be a very proper, little old woman.”\r\n\r\n“You must excuse me, indeed you must excuse me,” cried Fanny, growing\r\nmore and more red from excessive agitation, and looking distressfully\r\nat Edmund, who was kindly observing her; but unwilling to exasperate\r\nhis brother by interference, gave her only an encouraging smile.', 'Her\r\nentreaty had no effect on Tom: he only said again what he had said\r\nbefore; and it was not merely Tom, for the requisition was now backed\r\nby Maria, and Mr. Crawford, and Mr. Yates, with an urgency which\r\ndiffered from his but in being more gentle or more ceremonious, and\r\nwhich altogether was quite overpowering to Fanny; and before she could\r\nbreathe after it, Mrs. Norris completed the whole by thus addressing\r\nher in a whisper at once angry and audible—“What a piece of work here\r\nis about nothing: I am quite ashamed of you, Fanny, to make such a\r\ndifficulty of obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort—so kind as\r\nthey are to you!', 'Do not urge her any more.”\r\n\r\n“I am not going to urge her,” replied Mrs. Norris sharply; “but I shall\r\nthink her a very obstinate, ungrateful girl, if she does not do what\r\nher aunt and cousins wish her—very ungrateful, indeed, considering who\r\nand what she is.”\r\n\r\nEdmund was too angry to speak; but Miss Crawford, looking for a moment\r\nwith astonished eyes at Mrs. Norris, and then at Fanny, whose tears\r\nwere beginning to shew themselves, immediately said, with some\r\nkeenness, “I do not like my situation: this _place_ is too hot for me,”\r\nand moved away her chair to the opposite side of the table, close to\r\nFanny, saying to her, in a kind, low whisper, as she placed herself,\r\n“Never mind, my dear Miss Price, this is a cross evening: everybody is\r\ncross and teasing, but do not let us mind them”; and with pointed\r\nattention continued to talk to her and endeavour to raise her spirits,\r\nin spite of being out of spirits herself.', 'Fanny did not love Miss Crawford; but she felt very much obliged to her\r\nfor her present kindness; and when, from taking notice of her work, and\r\nwishing _she_ could work as well, and begging for the pattern, and\r\nsupposing Fanny was now preparing for her _appearance_, as of course\r\nshe would come out when her cousin was married, Miss Crawford proceeded\r\nto inquire if she had heard lately from her brother at sea, and said\r\nthat she had quite a curiosity to see him, and imagined him a very fine\r\nyoung man, and advised Fanny to get his picture drawn before he went to\r\nsea again—she could not help admitting it to be very agreeable\r\nflattery, or help listening, and answering with more animation than she\r\nhad intended.', 'The consultation upon the play still went on, and Miss Crawford’s\r\nattention was first called from Fanny by Tom Bertram’s telling her,\r\nwith infinite regret, that he found it absolutely impossible for him to\r\nundertake the part of Anhalt in addition to the Butler: he had been\r\nmost anxiously trying to make it out to be feasible, but it would not\r\ndo; he must give it up.', '“I am not very sanguine as to our play,” said Miss Crawford, in an\r\nundervoice to Fanny, after some consideration; “and I can tell Mr.\r\nMaddox that I shall shorten some of _his_ speeches, and a great many of\r\n_my_ _own_, before we rehearse together.', 'It will be very disagreeable,\r\nand by no means what I expected.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not in Miss Crawford’s power to talk Fanny into any real\r\nforgetfulness of what had passed.', 'The room had then\r\nbecome useless, and for some time was quite deserted, except by Fanny,\r\nwhen she visited her plants, or wanted one of the books, which she was\r\nstill glad to keep there, from the deficiency of space and\r\naccommodation in her little chamber above: but gradually, as her value\r\nfor the comforts of it increased, she had added to her possessions, and\r\nspent more of her time there; and having nothing to oppose her, had so\r\nnaturally and so artlessly worked herself into it, that it was now\r\ngenerally admitted to be hers.', 'The East room, as it had been called\r\never since Maria Bertram was sixteen, was now considered Fanny’s,\r\nalmost as decidedly as the white attic: the smallness of the one making\r\nthe use of the other so evidently reasonable that the Miss Bertrams,\r\nwith every superiority in their own apartments which their own sense of\r\nsuperiority could demand, were entirely approving it; and Mrs. Norris,\r\nhaving stipulated for there never being a fire in it on Fanny’s\r\naccount, was tolerably resigned to her having the use of what nobody\r\nelse wanted, though the terms in which she sometimes spoke of the\r\nindulgence seemed to imply that it was the best room in the house.', 'The aspect was so favourable that even without a fire it was habitable\r\nin many an early spring and late autumn morning to such a willing mind\r\nas Fanny’s; and while there was a gleam of sunshine she hoped not to be\r\ndriven from it entirely, even when winter came.', 'To this nest of comforts Fanny now walked down to try its influence on\r\nan agitated, doubting spirit, to see if by looking at Edmund’s profile\r\nshe could catch any of his counsel, or by giving air to her geraniums\r\nshe might inhale a breeze of mental strength herself.', '“Can I speak with you, Fanny, for a few minutes?” said he.', 'Your brother is so determined.”\r\n\r\n“There is but _one_ thing to be done, Fanny.', 'Can you,\r\nFanny?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Fanny slowly, “not immediately, but—”\r\n\r\n“But what?', 'Put yourself in Miss Crawford’s\r\nplace, Fanny.', 'Does it not strike you so, Fanny?', 'Can you mention any other\r\nmeasure by which I have a chance of doing equal good?”\r\n\r\n“No, I cannot think of anything else.”\r\n\r\n“Give me your approbation, then, Fanny.', 'It must be a great relief to her,”\r\nsaid Fanny, trying for greater warmth of manner.', 'And now, dear Fanny, I will not interrupt you\r\nany longer.', 'But do not stay here to be cold.”\r\n\r\nHe went; but there was no reading, no China, no composure for Fanny.', 'very well.” And not another word was said; but Fanny felt herself\r\nagain in danger, and her indifference to the danger was beginning to\r\nfail her already.', 'One\r\nadvantage resulted from it to Fanny: at the earnest request of Miss\r\nCrawford, Mrs. Grant had, with her usual good-humour, agreed to\r\nundertake the part for which Fanny had been wanted; and this was all\r\nthat occurred to gladden _her_ heart during the day; and even this,\r\nwhen imparted by Edmund, brought a pang with it, for it was Miss\r\nCrawford to whom she was obliged—it was Miss Crawford whose kind\r\nexertions were to excite her gratitude, and whose merit in making them\r\nwas spoken of with a glow of admiration.', 'Mrs. Grant\r\nwas of consequence: _her_ good-nature had honourable mention; her taste\r\nand her time were considered; her presence was wanted; she was sought\r\nfor, and attended, and praised; and Fanny was at first in some danger\r\nof envying her the character she had accepted.', 'Julia made no communication, and Fanny took no\r\nliberties.', 'CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nEverything was now in a regular train: theatre, actors, actresses, and\r\ndresses, were all getting forward; but though no other great\r\nimpediments arose, Fanny found, before many days were past, that it was\r\nnot all uninterrupted enjoyment to the party themselves, and that she\r\nhad not to witness the continuance of such unanimity and delight as had\r\nbeen almost too much for her at first.', 'Maria, she also thought, acted well, too well; and after the\r\nfirst rehearsal or two, Fanny began to be their only audience; and\r\nsometimes as prompter, sometimes as spectator, was often very useful.', '_You_ are best off, I can tell you: but if nobody did more than\r\n_you_, we should not get on very fast.”\r\n\r\nFanny took the work very quietly, without attempting any defence; but\r\nher kinder aunt Bertram observed on her behalf—\r\n\r\n“One cannot wonder, sister, that Fanny _should_ be delighted: it is all\r\nnew to her, you know; you and I used to be very fond of a play\r\nourselves, and so am I still; and as soon as I am a little more at\r\nleisure, _I_ mean to look in at their rehearsals too.', 'What is the play\r\nabout, Fanny?', 'sister, pray do not ask her now; for Fanny is not one of those who\r\ncan talk and work at the same time.', 'It is about Lovers’ Vows.”\r\n\r\n“I believe,” said Fanny to her aunt Bertram, “there will be three acts\r\nrehearsed to-morrow evening, and that will give you an opportunity of\r\nseeing all the actors at once.”\r\n\r\n“You had better stay till the curtain is hung,” interposed Mrs. Norris;\r\n“the curtain will be hung in a day or two—there is very little sense in\r\na play without a curtain—and I am much mistaken if you do not find it\r\ndraw up into very handsome festoons.”\r\n\r\nLady Bertram seemed quite resigned to waiting.', 'The morrow came, the plan for the evening continued, and Fanny’s\r\nconsideration of it did not become less agitated.', 'Now for my soliloquy.”\r\n\r\nShe began, and Fanny joined in with all the modest feeling which the\r\nidea of representing Edmund was so strongly calculated to inspire; but\r\nwith looks and voice so truly feminine as to be no very good picture of\r\na man.', 'He too had his book,\r\nand was seeking Fanny, to ask her to rehearse with him, and help him to\r\nprepare for the evening, without knowing Miss Crawford to be in the\r\nhouse; and great was the joy and animation of being thus thrown\r\ntogether, of comparing schemes, and sympathising in praise of Fanny’s\r\nkind offices.', 'Edmund proposed, urged, entreated it, till the lady,\r\nnot very unwilling at first, could refuse no longer, and Fanny was\r\nwanted only to prompt and observe them.', 'At last the scene was over, and Fanny forced\r\nherself to add her praise to the compliments each was giving the other;\r\nand when again alone and able to recall the whole, she was inclined to\r\nbelieve their performance would, indeed, have such nature and feeling\r\nin it as must ensure their credit, and make it a very suffering\r\nexhibition to herself.', 'After a pause of perplexity, some eyes\r\nbegan to be turned towards Fanny, and a voice or two to say, “If Miss\r\nPrice would be so good as to _read_ the part.” She was immediately\r\nsurrounded by supplications; everybody asked it; even Edmund said, “Do,\r\nFanny, if it is not _very_ disagreeable to you.”\r\n\r\nBut Fanny still hung back.', 'Sir Thomas was at that moment looking round him, and saying, “But where\r\nis Fanny?', 'Why do not I see my little Fanny?”—and on perceiving her,\r\ncame forward with a kindness which astonished and penetrated her,\r\ncalling her his dear Fanny, kissing her affectionately, and observing\r\nwith decided pleasure how much she was grown!', 'I hope you will take a day’s sport there yourself, sir,\r\nsoon.”\r\n\r\nFor the present the danger was over, and Fanny’s sick feelings\r\nsubsided; but when tea was soon afterwards brought in, and Sir Thomas,\r\ngetting up, said that he found that he could not be any longer in the\r\nhouse without just looking into his own dear room, every agitation was\r\nreturning.', '“Where did you leave Miss Crawford, Fanny?”\r\n\r\nFanny told of their departure, and delivered their message.', 'Not\r\nless acutely was it felt by Fanny, who had edged back her chair behind\r\nher aunt’s end of the sofa, and, screened from notice herself, saw all\r\nthat was passing before her.', '“We have all been more or less to blame,” said\r\nhe, “every one of us, excepting Fanny.', 'You will find Fanny everything you could wish.”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas saw all the impropriety of such a scheme among such a party,\r\nand at such a time, as strongly as his son had ever supposed he must;\r\nhe felt it too much, indeed, for many words; and having shaken hands\r\nwith Edmund, meant to try to lose the disagreeable impression, and\r\nforget how much he had been forgotten himself as soon as he could,\r\nafter the house had been cleared of every object enforcing the\r\nremembrance, and restored to its proper state.', 'With a purer spirit did Fanny rejoice in the intelligence.', '“But they,”\r\nhe observed to Fanny, “have a claim.', 'Dr. and Mrs. Grant would enliven us, and make our evenings\r\npass away with more enjoyment even to my father.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think so?” said Fanny: “in my opinion, my uncle would not like\r\n_any_ addition.', '“I believe you are right, Fanny,” was his reply, after a short\r\nconsideration.', 'I have been feeling as if we had never lived so before.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose I am graver than other people,” said Fanny.', 'But when did you, or anybody, ever get a compliment from me, Fanny?', 'Ask\r\nyour uncle what he thinks, and you will hear compliments enough: and\r\nthough they may be chiefly on your person, you must put up with it, and\r\ntrust to his seeing as much beauty of mind in time.”\r\n\r\nSuch language was so new to Fanny that it quite embarrassed her.', '“Your uncle thinks you very pretty, dear Fanny—and that is the long and\r\nthe short of the matter.', 'don’t talk so, don’t talk so,” cried Fanny, distressed by more\r\nfeelings than he was aware of; but seeing that she was distressed, he\r\nhad done with the subject, and only added more seriously—\r\n\r\n“Your uncle is disposed to be pleased with you in every respect; and I\r\nonly wish you would talk to him more.', 'I hope she does not suppose there is any dislike on\r\nhis side.”\r\n\r\n“She must know herself too secure of the regard of all the rest of\r\nyou,” said Fanny, with half a sigh, “to have any such apprehension.', 'I hope my uncle\r\nmay continue to like Mr. Rushworth.”\r\n\r\n“That is impossible, Fanny.', 'Becoming, as she then did, the only young woman in the drawing-room,\r\nthe only occupier of that interesting division of a family in which she\r\nhad hitherto held so humble a third, it was impossible for her not to\r\nbe more looked at, more thought of and attended to, than she had ever\r\nbeen before; and “Where is Fanny?” became no uncommon question, even\r\nwithout her being wanted for any one’s convenience.', 'Mrs.\r\nGrant, really eager to get any change for her sister, could, by the\r\neasiest self-deceit, persuade herself that she was doing the kindest\r\nthing by Fanny, and giving her the most important opportunities of\r\nimprovement in pressing her frequent calls.', 'She was all alive again directly, and among the most active in being\r\nuseful to Fanny, in detecting her to be wetter than she would at first\r\nallow, and providing her with dry clothes; and Fanny, after being\r\nobliged to submit to all this attention, and to being assisted and\r\nwaited on by mistresses and maids, being also obliged, on returning\r\ndownstairs, to be fixed in their drawing-room for an hour while the\r\nrain continued, the blessing of something fresh to see and think of was\r\nthus extended to Miss Crawford, and might carry on her spirits to the\r\nperiod of dressing and dinner.', 'The two sisters were so kind to her, and so pleasant, that Fanny might\r\nhave enjoyed her visit could she have believed herself not in the way,\r\nand could she have foreseen that the weather would certainly clear at\r\nthe end of the hour, and save her from the shame of having Dr. Grant’s\r\ncarriage and horses out to take her home, with which she was\r\nthreatened.', 'It was beginning to look brighter, when Fanny, observing a harp in the\r\nroom, asked some questions about it, which soon led to an\r\nacknowledgment of her wishing very much to hear it, and a confession,\r\nwhich could hardly be believed, of her having never yet heard it since\r\nits being in Mansfield.', 'To Fanny herself it appeared a very simple and\r\nnatural circumstance.', 'She played till Fanny’s eyes,\r\nstraying to the window on the weather’s being evidently fair, spoke\r\nwhat she felt must be done.', 'Those\r\nclouds look alarming.”\r\n\r\n“But they are passed over,” said Fanny.', 'Such was the origin of the sort of intimacy which took place between\r\nthem within the first fortnight after the Miss Bertrams’ going away—an\r\nintimacy resulting principally from Miss Crawford’s desire of something\r\nnew, and which had little reality in Fanny’s feelings.', 'She went,\r\nhowever, and they sauntered about together many an half-hour in Mrs.\r\nGrant’s shrubbery, the weather being unusually mild for the time of\r\nyear, and venturing sometimes even to sit down on one of the benches\r\nnow comparatively unsheltered, remaining there perhaps till, in the\r\nmidst of some tender ejaculation of Fanny’s on the sweets of so\r\nprotracted an autumn, they were forced, by the sudden swell of a cold\r\ngust shaking down the last few yellow leaves about them, to jump up and\r\nwalk for warmth.', '“This is pretty, very pretty,” said Fanny, looking around her as they\r\nwere thus sitting together one day; “every time I come into this\r\nshrubbery I am more struck with its growth and beauty.', 'One does not think of extent _here_; and between\r\nourselves, till I came to Mansfield, I had not imagined a country\r\nparson ever aspired to a shrubbery, or anything of the kind.”\r\n\r\n“I am so glad to see the evergreens thrive!” said Fanny, in reply.', 'One need not envy\r\nthe new Mrs. Rushworth with such a home as _that_.”\r\n\r\n“Envy Mrs. Rushworth!” was all that Fanny attempted to say.', 'There is something in the sound of Mr. _Edmund_ Bertram\r\nso formal, so pitiful, so younger-brother-like, that I detest it.”\r\n\r\n“How differently we feel!” cried Fanny.', 'A friendship\r\nbetween two so very dear to him was exactly what he could have wished:\r\nand to the credit of the lover’s understanding, be it stated, that he\r\ndid not by any means consider Fanny as the only, or even as the greater\r\ngainer by such a friendship.', 'No,\r\nMiss Crawford,” he added, in a more serious tone, “there _are_\r\ndistinctions which I should be miserable if I thought myself without\r\nany chance—absolutely without chance or possibility of obtaining—but\r\nthey are of a different character.”\r\n\r\nA look of consciousness as he spoke, and what seemed a consciousness of\r\nmanner on Miss Crawford’s side as she made some laughing answer, was\r\nsorrowfull food for Fanny’s observation; and finding herself quite\r\nunable to attend as she ought to Mrs. Grant, by whose side she was now\r\nfollowing the others, she had nearly resolved on going home\r\nimmediately, and only waited for courage to say so, when the sound of\r\nthe great clock at Mansfield Park, striking three, made her feel that\r\nshe had really been much longer absent than usual, and brought the\r\nprevious self-inquiry of whether she should take leave or not just\r\nthen, and how, to a very speedy issue.', 'In the moment of parting, Edmund was invited by Dr. Grant\r\nto eat his mutton with him the next day; and Fanny had barely time for\r\nan unpleasant feeling on the occasion, when Mrs. Grant, with sudden\r\nrecollection, turned to her and asked for the pleasure of her company\r\ntoo.', 'This was so new an attention, so perfectly new a circumstance in\r\nthe events of Fanny’s life, that she was all surprise and\r\nembarrassment; and while stammering out her great obligation, and her\r\n“but she did not suppose it would be in her power,” was looking at\r\nEdmund for his opinion and help.', 'But Edmund, delighted with her having\r\nsuch an happiness offered, and ascertaining with half a look, and half\r\na sentence, that she had no objection but on her aunt’s account, could\r\nnot imagine that his mother would make any difficulty of sparing her,\r\nand therefore gave his decided open advice that the invitation should\r\nbe accepted; and though Fanny would not venture, even on his\r\nencouragement, to such a flight of audacious independence, it was soon\r\nsettled, that if nothing were heard to the contrary, Mrs. Grant might\r\nexpect her.', 'CHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n\r\n“But why should Mrs. Grant ask Fanny?” said Lady Bertram.', '“How came she\r\nto think of asking Fanny?', 'She used to ask your sisters now and then, but she never\r\nasked Fanny.”\r\n\r\n“If you cannot do without me, ma’am—” said Fanny, in a self-denying\r\ntone.', 'But he will be very much surprised\r\nthat Mrs. Grant should ask Fanny at all.”\r\n\r\nThere was nothing more to be said, or that could be said to any\r\npurpose, till Sir Thomas were present; but the subject involving, as it\r\ndid, her own evening’s comfort for the morrow, was so much uppermost in\r\nLady Bertram’s mind, that half an hour afterwards, on his looking in\r\nfor a minute in his way from his plantation to his dressing-room, she\r\ncalled him back again, when he had almost closed the door, with “Sir\r\nThomas, stop a moment—I have something to say to you.”\r\n\r\nHer tone of calm languor, for she never took the trouble of raising her\r\nvoice, was always heard and attended to; and Sir Thomas came back.', 'Her\r\nstory began; and Fanny immediately slipped out of the room; for to hear\r\nherself the subject of any discussion with her uncle was more than her\r\nnerves could bear.', 'Mrs. Grant has asked Fanny to dinner.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Sir Thomas, as if waiting more to accomplish the surprise.', 'But as I conclude that she\r\nmust wish to go, since all young people like to be together, I can see\r\nno reason why she should be denied the indulgence.”\r\n\r\n“But can I do without her, Sir Thomas?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed I think you may.”\r\n\r\n“She always makes tea, you know, when my sister is not here.”\r\n\r\n“Your sister, perhaps, may be prevailed on to spend the day with us,\r\nand I shall certainly be at home.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, then, Fanny may go, Edmund.”\r\n\r\nThe good news soon followed her.', '“Well, Fanny, it is all happily settled, and without the smallest\r\nhesitation on your uncle’s side.', 'You are to\r\ngo.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, I am _so_ glad,” was Fanny’s instinctive reply; though when\r\nshe had turned from him and shut the door, she could not help feeling,\r\n“And yet why should I be glad?', '“Upon my word, Fanny, you are in high luck to meet with such attention\r\nand indulgence!', 'Mrs. Grant thinks it a civility due to\r\n_us_ to take a little notice of you, or else it would never have come\r\ninto her head, and you may be very certain that, if your cousin Julia\r\nhad been at home, you would not have been asked at all.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris had now so ingeniously done away all Mrs. Grant’s part of\r\nthe favour, that Fanny, who found herself expected to speak, could only\r\nsay that she was very much obliged to her aunt Bertram for sparing her,\r\nand that she was endeavouring to put her aunt’s evening work in such a\r\nstate as to prevent her being missed.', 'Remember that, Fanny.', '“The nonsense and folly of people’s stepping out of their rank and\r\ntrying to appear above themselves, makes me think it right to give\r\n_you_ a hint, Fanny, now that you are going into company without any of\r\nus; and I do beseech and entreat you not to be putting yourself\r\nforward, and talking and giving your opinion as if you were one of your\r\ncousins—as if you were dear Mrs. Rushworth or Julia.', 'Will twenty minutes after four suit you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” was Fanny’s humble answer, given with the feelings almost\r\nof a criminal towards Mrs. Norris; and not bearing to remain with her\r\nin what might seem a state of triumph, she followed her uncle out of\r\nthe room, having staid behind him only long enough to hear these words\r\nspoken in angry agitation—\r\n\r\n“Quite unnecessary!', 'I observed he was hoarse on Thursday night.”\r\n\r\nBut this could not impose on Fanny.', '“Now I must look at you, Fanny,” said Edmund, with the kind smile of an\r\naffectionate brother, “and tell you how I like you; and as well as I\r\ncan judge by this light, you look very nicely indeed.', 'This\r\nis quite a surprise, Fanny.', 'I shall be very glad to see him.”\r\n\r\nThere was no occasion, there was no time for Fanny to say how very\r\ndifferently she felt; but the idea of having such another to observe\r\nher was a great increase of the trepidation with which she performed\r\nthe very awful ceremony of walking into the drawing-room.', 'A\r\nvery cordial meeting passed between him and Edmund; and with the\r\nexception of Fanny, the pleasure was general; and even to _her_ there\r\nmight be some advantage in his presence, since every addition to the\r\nparty must rather forward her favourite indulgence of being suffered to\r\nsit silent and unattended to.', 'With a significant smile, which\r\nmade Fanny quite hate him, he said, “So!', 'I never was happier.”\r\n\r\nWith silent indignation Fanny repeated to herself, “Never\r\nhappier!—never happier than when doing what you must know was not\r\njustifiable!—never happier than when behaving so dishonourably and\r\nunfeelingly!', 'I\r\nthink, Miss Price, we would have indulged ourselves with a week’s calm\r\nin the Atlantic at that season.”\r\n\r\nHe seemed determined to be answered; and Fanny, averting her face,\r\nsaid, with a firmer tone than usual, “As far as _I_ am concerned, sir,\r\nI would not have delayed his return for a day.', 'You must preach at Mansfield, you know, that\r\nSir Thomas and Lady Bertram may hear you.”\r\n\r\n“I shall keep clear of you, Crawford, as long as I can,” said Edmund;\r\n“for you would be more likely to disconcert me, and I should be more\r\nsorry to see you trying at it than almost any other man.”\r\n\r\n“Will he not feel this?” thought Fanny.', 'No, my\r\nplan is to make Fanny Price in love with me.”\r\n\r\n“Fanny Price!', 'You ought to be satisfied with her two\r\ncousins.”\r\n\r\n“But I cannot be satisfied without Fanny Price, without making a small\r\nhole in Fanny Price’s heart.', 'Her eyes should be darker, but she has a sweet\r\nsmile; but as for this wonderful degree of improvement, I am sure it\r\nmay all be resolved into a better style of dress, and your having\r\nnobody else to look at; and therefore, if you do set about a flirtation\r\nwith her, you never will persuade me that it is in compliment to her\r\nbeauty, or that it proceeds from anything but your own idleness and\r\nfolly.”\r\n\r\nHer brother gave only a smile to this accusation, and soon afterwards\r\nsaid, “I do not quite know what to make of Miss Fanny.', 'Well, you\r\nwill have opportunities enough of endeavouring to recommend yourself,\r\nfor we are a great deal together.”\r\n\r\nAnd without attempting any farther remonstrance, she left Fanny to her\r\nfate, a fate which, had not Fanny’s heart been guarded in a way\r\nunsuspected by Miss Crawford, might have been a little harder than she\r\ndeserved; for although there doubtless are such unconquerable young\r\nladies of eighteen (or one should not read about them) as are never to\r\nbe persuaded into love against their judgment by all that talent,\r\nmanner, attention, and flattery can do, I have no inclination to\r\nbelieve Fanny one of them, or to think that with so much tenderness of\r\ndisposition, and so much taste as belonged to her, she could have\r\nescaped heart-whole from the courtship (though the courtship only of a\r\nfortnight) of such a man as Crawford, in spite of there being some\r\nprevious ill opinion of him to be overcome, had not her affection been\r\nengaged elsewhere.', 'There could be no doubt\r\nof his obtaining leave of absence immediately, for he was still only a\r\nmidshipman; and as his parents, from living on the spot, must already\r\nhave seen him, and be seeing him perhaps daily, his direct holidays\r\nmight with justice be instantly given to the sister, who had been his\r\nbest correspondent through a period of seven years, and the uncle who\r\nhad done most for his support and advancement; and accordingly the\r\nreply to her reply, fixing a very early day for his arrival, came as\r\nsoon as possible; and scarcely ten days had passed since Fanny had been\r\nin the agitation of her first dinner-visit, when she found herself in\r\nan agitation of a higher nature, watching in the hall, in the lobby, on\r\nthe stairs, for the first sound of the carriage which was to bring her\r\na brother.', 'William and Fanny soon shewed themselves; and Sir Thomas had the\r\npleasure of receiving, in his protégé, certainly a very different\r\nperson from the one he had equipped seven years ago, but a young man of\r\nan open, pleasant countenance, and frank, unstudied, but feeling and\r\nrespectful manners, and such as confirmed him his friend.', 'It was long before Fanny could recover from the agitating happiness of\r\nsuch an hour as was formed by the last thirty minutes of expectation,\r\nand the first of fruition; it was some time even before her happiness\r\ncould be said to make her happy, before the disappointment inseparable\r\nfrom the alteration of person had vanished, and she could see in him\r\nthe same William as before, and talk to him, as her heart had been\r\nyearning to do through many a past year.', 'Excepting the moments of peculiar delight, which any marked or\r\nunlooked-for instance of Edmund’s consideration of her in the last few\r\nmonths had excited, Fanny had never known so much felicity in her life,\r\nas in this unchecked, equal, fearless intercourse with the brother and\r\nfriend who was opening all his heart to her, telling her all his hopes\r\nand fears, plans, and solicitudes respecting that long thought of,\r\ndearly earned, and justly valued blessing of promotion; who could give\r\nher direct and minute information of the father and mother, brothers\r\nand sisters, of whom she very seldom heard; who was interested in all\r\nthe comforts and all the little hardships of her home at Mansfield;\r\nready to think of every member of that home as she directed, or\r\ndiffering only by a less scrupulous opinion, and more noisy abuse of\r\ntheir aunt Norris, and with whom (perhaps the dearest indulgence of the\r\nwhole) all the evil and good of their earliest years could be gone over\r\nagain, and every former united pain and pleasure retraced with the\r\nfondest recollection.', 'But with William\r\nand Fanny Price it was still a sentiment in all its prime and\r\nfreshness, wounded by no opposition of interest, cooled by no separate\r\nattachment, and feeling the influence of time and absence only in its\r\nincrease.', 'He honoured the warm-hearted, blunt fondness of the\r\nyoung sailor, which led him to say, with his hands stretched towards\r\nFanny’s head, “Do you know, I begin to like that queer fashion already,\r\nthough when I first heard of such things being done in England, I could\r\nnot believe it; and when Mrs. Brown, and the other women at the\r\nCommissioner’s at Gibraltar, appeared in the same trim, I thought they\r\nwere mad; but Fanny can reconcile me to anything”; and saw, with lively\r\nadmiration, the glow of Fanny’s cheek, the brightness of her eye, the\r\ndeep interest, the absorbed attention, while her brother was describing\r\nany of the imminent hazards, or terrific scenes, which such a period at\r\nsea must supply.', 'With spirits, courage, and\r\ncuriosity up to anything, William expressed an inclination to hunt; and\r\nCrawford could mount him without the slightest inconvenience to\r\nhimself, and with only some scruples to obviate in Sir Thomas, who knew\r\nbetter than his nephew the value of such a loan, and some alarms to\r\nreason away in Fanny.', 'His readiness, however, in agreeing to dine at the Parsonage, when the\r\ngeneral invitation was at last hazarded, after many debates and many\r\ndoubts as to whether it were worth while, “because Sir Thomas seemed so\r\nill inclined, and Lady Bertram was so indolent!” proceeded from\r\ngood-breeding and goodwill alone, and had nothing to do with Mr.\r\nCrawford, but as being one in an agreeable group: for it was in the\r\ncourse of that very visit that he first began to think that any one in\r\nthe habit of such idle observations _would_ _have_ _thought_ that Mr.\r\nCrawford was the admirer of Fanny Price.', 'I know nothing about it, but Fanny must teach\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nHere Fanny interposed, however, with anxious protestations of her own\r\nequal ignorance; she had never played the game nor seen it played in\r\nher life; and Lady Bertram felt a moment’s indecision again; but upon\r\neverybody’s assuring her that nothing could be so easy, that it was the\r\neasiest game on the cards, and Henry Crawford’s stepping forward with a\r\nmost earnest request to be allowed to sit between her ladyship and Miss\r\nPrice, and teach them both, it was so settled; and Sir Thomas, Mrs.\r\nNorris, and Dr. and Mrs. Grant being seated at the table of prime\r\nintellectual state and dignity, the remaining six, under Miss\r\nCrawford’s direction, were arranged round the other.', 'It was a fine\r\narrangement for Henry Crawford, who was close to Fanny, and with his\r\nhands full of business, having two persons’ cards to manage as well as\r\nhis own; for though it was impossible for Fanny not to feel herself\r\nmistress of the rules of the game in three minutes, he had yet to\r\ninspirit her play, sharpen her avarice, and harden her heart, which,\r\nespecially in any competition with William, was a work of some\r\ndifficulty; and as for Lady Bertram, he must continue in charge of all\r\nher fame and fortune through the whole evening; and if quick enough to\r\nkeep her from looking at her cards when the deal began, must direct her\r\nin whatever was to be done with them to the end of it.', '_You_ think with me, I hope” (turning with a softened\r\nvoice to Fanny).', 'The game will be yours,” turning to her again; “it\r\nwill certainly be yours.”\r\n\r\n“And Fanny had much rather it were William’s,” said Edmund, smiling at\r\nher.', '“Poor Fanny!', 'With something of consciousness he shook his head at his\r\nsister, and laughingly replied, “I cannot say there was much done at\r\nSotherton; but it was a hot day, and we were all walking after each\r\nother, and bewildered.” As soon as a general buzz gave him shelter, he\r\nadded, in a low voice, directed solely at Fanny, “I should be sorry to\r\nhave my powers of _planning_ judged of by the day at Sotherton.', 'There was no want of respect in the young man’s\r\naddress; and Fanny’s reception of it was so proper and modest, so calm\r\nand uninviting, that he had nothing to censure in her.', 'We must hope his son may prove that _he_ knows it too.”\r\n\r\nWhatever effect Sir Thomas’s little harangue might really produce on\r\nMr. Crawford, it raised some awkward sensations in two of the others,\r\ntwo of his most attentive listeners—Miss Crawford and Fanny.', 'William and Fanny were the most\r\ndetached.', '“If I were at Portsmouth I\r\nshould be at it, perhaps.”\r\n\r\n“But you do not wish yourself at Portsmouth, William?”\r\n\r\n“No, Fanny, that I do not.', 'only think, William, when you are a lieutenant, how\r\nlittle you will care for any nonsense of this kind.”\r\n\r\n“I begin to think I shall never be a lieutenant, Fanny.', '“Are you fond of dancing, Fanny?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, very; only I am soon tired.”\r\n\r\n“I should like to go to a ball with you and see you dance.', 'I have never seen Fanny dance since she was a\r\nlittle girl; but I trust we shall both think she acquits herself like a\r\ngentlewoman when we do see her, which, perhaps, we may have an\r\nopportunity of doing ere long.”\r\n\r\n“I have had the pleasure of seeing your sister dance, Mr. Price,” said\r\nHenry Crawford, leaning forward, “and will engage to answer every\r\ninquiry which you can make on the subject, to your entire satisfaction.', 'But I believe” (seeing Fanny looked distressed) “it must be at some\r\nother time.', 'There is _one_ person in company who does not like to have\r\nMiss Price spoken of.”\r\n\r\nTrue enough, he had once seen Fanny dance; and it was equally true that\r\nhe would now have answered for her gliding about with quiet, light\r\nelegance, and in admirable time; but, in fact, he could not for the\r\nlife of him recall what her dancing had been, and rather took it for\r\ngranted that she had been present than remembered anything about her.', '“Come, Fanny, Fanny, what are you about?', 'CHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam’s desire of seeing Fanny dance made more than a momentary\r\nimpression on his uncle.', 'He remained\r\nsteadily inclined to gratify so amiable a feeling; to gratify anybody\r\nelse who might wish to see Fanny dance, and to give pleasure to the\r\nyoung people in general; and having thought the matter over, and taken\r\nhis resolution in quiet independence, the result of it appeared the\r\nnext morning at breakfast, when, after recalling and commending what\r\nhis nephew had said, he added, “I do not like, William, that you should\r\nleave Northamptonshire without this indulgence.', 'Edmund, William, and Fanny did, in their different ways, look and speak\r\nas much grateful pleasure in the promised ball as Sir Thomas could\r\ndesire.', 'Invitations were sent with despatch,\r\nand many a young lady went to bed that night with her head full of\r\nhappy cares as well as Fanny.', 'Thursday was the day of the ball; and on Wednesday morning Fanny, still\r\nunable to satisfy herself as to what she ought to wear, determined to\r\nseek the counsel of the more enlightened, and apply to Mrs. Grant and\r\nher sister, whose acknowledged taste would certainly bear her\r\nblameless; and as Edmund and William were gone to Northampton, and she\r\nhad reason to think Mr. Crawford likewise out, she walked down to the\r\nParsonage without much fear of wanting an opportunity for private\r\ndiscussion; and the privacy of such a discussion was a most important\r\npart of it to Fanny, being more than half-ashamed of her own\r\nsolicitude.', 'Miss Crawford appeared gratified by the\r\napplication, and after a moment’s thought, urged Fanny’s returning with\r\nher in a much more cordial manner than before, and proposed their going\r\nup into her room, where they might have a comfortable coze, without\r\ndisturbing Dr. and Mrs. Grant, who were together in the drawing-room.', 'It was just the plan to suit Fanny; and with a great deal of gratitude\r\non her side for such ready and kind attention, they proceeded indoors,\r\nand upstairs, and were soon deep in the interesting subject.', '“Shall not you wear your brother’s cross?” And as\r\nshe spoke she was undoing a small parcel, which Fanny had observed in\r\nher hand when they met.', 'Such had been the parcel with which Miss Crawford\r\nwas provided, and such the object of her intended visit: and in the\r\nkindest manner she now urged Fanny’s taking one for the cross and to\r\nkeep for her sake, saying everything she could think of to obviate the\r\nscruples which were making Fanny start back at first with a look of\r\nhorror at the proposal.', 'It was\r\nof gold, prettily worked; and though Fanny would have preferred a\r\nlonger and a plainer chain as more adapted for her purpose, she hoped,\r\nin fixing on this, to be chusing what Miss Crawford least wished to\r\nkeep.', 'or perhaps”—looking archly—“you suspect a\r\nconfederacy between us, and that what I am now doing is with his\r\nknowledge and at his desire?”\r\n\r\nWith the deepest blushes Fanny protested against such a thought.', 'CHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nOn reaching home Fanny went immediately upstairs to deposit this\r\nunexpected acquisition, this doubtful good of a necklace, in some\r\nfavourite box in the East room, which held all her smaller treasures;\r\nbut on opening the door, what was her surprise to find her cousin\r\nEdmund there writing at the table!', 'I hope you will like the chain itself, Fanny.', 'I\r\nendeavoured to consult the simplicity of your taste; but, at any rate,\r\nI know you will be kind to my intentions, and consider it, as it really\r\nis, a token of the love of one of your oldest friends.”\r\n\r\nAnd so saying, he was hurrying away, before Fanny, overpowered by a\r\nthousand feelings of pain and pleasure, could attempt to speak; but\r\nquickened by one sovereign wish, she then called out, “Oh!', 'Your goodness in thinking of me in such a way is\r\nbeyond—”\r\n\r\n“If that is all you have to say, Fanny” smiling and turning away again.', 'Oh, cousin, you do not know how acceptable it is.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Fanny, you feel these things a great deal too much.', 'It is without a drawback.”\r\n\r\nUpon such expressions of affection Fanny could have lived an hour\r\nwithout saying another word; but Edmund, after waiting a moment,\r\nobliged her to bring down her mind from its heavenly flight by saying,\r\n“But what is it that you want to consult me about?”\r\n\r\nIt was about the necklace, which she was now most earnestly longing to\r\nreturn, and hoped to obtain his approbation of her doing.', 'She gave the\r\nhistory of her recent visit, and now her raptures might well be over;\r\nfor Edmund was so struck with the circumstance, so delighted with what\r\nMiss Crawford had done, so gratified by such a coincidence of conduct\r\nbetween them, that Fanny could not but admit the superior power of one\r\npleasure over his own mind, though it might have its drawback.', 'No, my dear Fanny, upon no account.', 'Why should she lose a pleasure which she has shewn herself so\r\ndeserving of?”\r\n\r\n“If it had been given to me in the first instance,” said Fanny, “I\r\nshould not have thought of returning it; but being her brother’s\r\npresent, is not it fair to suppose that she would rather not part with\r\nit, when it is not wanted?”\r\n\r\n“She must not suppose it not wanted, not acceptable, at least: and its\r\nhaving been originally her brother’s gift makes no difference; for as\r\nshe was not prevented from offering, nor you from taking it on that\r\naccount, it ought not to prevent you from keeping it.', 'The chain will agree with William’s cross\r\nbeyond all comparison better than the necklace.”\r\n\r\n“For one night, Fanny, for only one night, if it _be_ a sacrifice; I am\r\nsure you will, upon consideration, make that sacrifice rather than give\r\npain to one who has been so studious of your comfort.', 'I would not have the shadow of a coolness arise,” he\r\nrepeated, his voice sinking a little, “between the two dearest objects\r\nI have on earth.”\r\n\r\nHe was gone as he spoke; and Fanny remained to tranquillise herself as\r\nshe could.', 'Till she had shed\r\nmany tears over this deception, Fanny could not subdue her agitation;\r\nand the dejection which followed could only be relieved by the\r\ninfluence of fervent prayers for his happiness.', 'This specimen, written in haste as it was, had not a fault; and there\r\nwas a felicity in the flow of the first four words, in the arrangement\r\nof “My very dear Fanny,” which she could have looked at for ever.', 'Thursday, predestined to hope and enjoyment, came; and opened with more\r\nkindness to Fanny than such self-willed, unmanageable days often\r\nvolunteer, for soon after breakfast a very friendly note was brought\r\nfrom Mr. Crawford to William, stating that as he found himself obliged\r\nto go to London on the morrow for a few days, he could not help trying\r\nto procure a companion; and therefore hoped that if William could make\r\nup his mind to leave Mansfield half a day earlier than had been\r\nproposed, he would accept a place in his carriage.', 'The proposal was a very\r\npleasant one to William himself, who enjoyed the idea of travelling\r\npost with four horses, and such a good-humoured, agreeable friend; and,\r\nin likening it to going up with despatches, was saying at once\r\neverything in favour of its happiness and dignity which his imagination\r\ncould suggest; and Fanny, from a different motive, was exceedingly\r\npleased; for the original plan was that William should go up by the\r\nmail from Northampton the following night, which would not have allowed\r\nhim an hour’s rest before he must have got into a Portsmouth coach; and\r\nthough this offer of Mr. Crawford’s would rob her of many hours of his\r\ncompany, she was too happy in having William spared from the fatigue of\r\nsuch a journey, to think of anything else.', 'William, determined to\r\nmake this last day a day of thorough enjoyment, was out snipe-shooting;\r\nEdmund, she had too much reason to suppose, was at the Parsonage; and\r\nleft alone to bear the worrying of Mrs. Norris, who was cross because\r\nthe housekeeper would have her own way with the supper, and whom _she_\r\ncould not avoid though the housekeeper might, Fanny was worn down at\r\nlast to think everything an evil belonging to the ball, and when sent\r\noff with a parting worry to dress, moved as languidly towards her own\r\nroom, and felt as incapable of happiness as if she had been allowed no\r\nshare in it.', '“You look tired and fagged, Fanny.', '“You may guess my\r\nerrand there, Fanny.” And he looked so conscious, that Fanny could\r\nthink but of one errand, which turned her too sick for speech.', '“I\r\nwished to engage Miss Crawford for the two first dances,” was the\r\nexplanation that followed, and brought Fanny to life again, enabling\r\nher, as she found she was expected to speak, to utter something like an\r\ninquiry as to the result.', 'But, Fanny,” stopping her, by\r\ntaking her hand, and speaking low and seriously, “you know what all\r\nthis means.', 'She does not _think_ evil, but\r\nshe speaks it, speaks it in playfulness; and though I know it to be\r\nplayfulness, it grieves me to the soul.”\r\n\r\n“The effect of education,” said Fanny gently.', 'They have\r\ninjured the finest mind; for sometimes, Fanny, I own to you, it does\r\nappear more than manner: it appears as if the mind itself was tainted.”\r\n\r\nFanny imagined this to be an appeal to her judgment, and therefore,\r\nafter a moment’s consideration, said, “If you only want me as a\r\nlistener, cousin, I will be as useful as I can; but I am not qualified\r\nfor an adviser.', 'I am not competent.”\r\n\r\n“You are right, Fanny, to protest against such an office, but you need\r\nnot be afraid.', '“Dearest Fanny!” cried Edmund, pressing her hand to his lips with\r\nalmost as much warmth as if it had been Miss Crawford’s, “you are all\r\nconsiderate thought!', 'He had said\r\nenough to give Fanny some happier feelings than she had lately known,\r\nand with a brighter look, she answered, “Yes, cousin, I am convinced\r\nthat _you_ would be incapable of anything else, though perhaps some\r\nmight not.', 'For Fanny’s present comfort it was\r\nconcluded, perhaps, at the happiest moment: had he been able to talk\r\nanother five minutes, there is no saying that he might not have talked\r\naway all Miss Crawford’s faults and his own despondence.', 'The necklace really looked very\r\nwell; and Fanny left her room at last, comfortably satisfied with\r\nherself and all about her.', 'Mrs. Chapman\r\nhad just reached the attic floor, when Miss Price came out of her room\r\ncompletely dressed, and only civilities were necessary; but Fanny felt\r\nher aunt’s attention almost as much as Lady Bertram or Mrs. Chapman\r\ncould do themselves.', 'CHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nHer uncle and both her aunts were in the drawing-room when Fanny went\r\ndown.', 'From a variety of causes she was happy, and she was soon made\r\nstill happier; for in following her aunts out of the room, Edmund, who\r\nwas holding open the door, said, as she passed him, “You must dance\r\nwith me, Fanny; you must keep two dances for me; any two that you like,\r\nexcept the first.” She had nothing more to wish for.', 'Half an hour followed that would have been at least languid under any\r\nother circumstances, but Fanny’s happiness still prevailed.', 'When the company were moving into the ballroom, she found herself for\r\nthe first time near Miss Crawford, whose eyes and smiles were\r\nimmediately and more unequivocally directed as her brother’s had been,\r\nand who was beginning to speak on the subject, when Fanny, anxious to\r\nget the story over, hastened to give the explanation of the second\r\nnecklace: the real chain.', 'Miss Crawford listened; and all her intended\r\ncompliments and insinuations to Fanny were forgotten: she felt only one\r\nthing; and her eyes, bright as they had been before, shewing they could\r\nyet be brighter, she exclaimed with eager pleasure, “Did he?', 'Mr. Crawford was not far off; Sir Thomas brought him to her,\r\nsaying something which discovered to Fanny, that _she_ was to lead the\r\nway and open the ball; an idea that had never occurred to her before.', 'It was rather honour than happiness to Fanny, for the\r\nfirst dance at least: her partner was in excellent spirits, and tried\r\nto impart them to her; but she was a great deal too much frightened to\r\nhave any enjoyment till she could suppose herself no longer looked at.', 'Miss Crawford saw much of Sir Thomas’s thoughts as he stood, and\r\nhaving, in spite of all his wrongs towards her, a general prevailing\r\ndesire of recommending herself to him, took an opportunity of stepping\r\naside to say something agreeable of Fanny.', 'I sent Chapman to her.” Not but that she\r\nwas really pleased to have Fanny admired; but she was so much more\r\nstruck with her own kindness in sending Chapman to her, that she could\r\nnot get it out of her head.', 'Miss Crawford knew Mrs. Norris too well to think of gratifying _her_ by\r\ncommendation of Fanny; to her, it was as the occasion offered—“Ah!', 'Miss Crawford blundered most towards Fanny herself in her intentions to\r\nplease.', 'She meant to be giving her little heart a happy flutter, and\r\nfilling her with sensations of delightful self-consequence; and,\r\nmisinterpreting Fanny’s blushes, still thought she must be doing so\r\nwhen she went to her after the two first dances, and said, with a\r\nsignificant look, “Perhaps _you_ can tell me why my brother goes to\r\ntown to-morrow?', 'But with _you_, Fanny, there may be peace.', 'Let us have the luxury of silence.” Fanny would hardly even\r\nspeak her agreement.', '“Poor Fanny!” cried William, coming for a moment to visit her, and\r\nworking away his partner’s fan as if for life, “how soon she is knocked\r\nup!', 'my good friend,” said Sir Thomas, producing his watch with\r\nall necessary caution; “it is three o’clock, and your sister is not\r\nused to these sort of hours.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, Fanny, you shall not get up to-morrow before I go.', 'yes, sir,” cried Fanny, rising eagerly from her seat to be nearer\r\nher uncle; “I must get up and breakfast with him.', '“Yes, half-past nine,” said Crawford to William as the latter was\r\nleaving them, “and I shall be punctual, for there will be no kind\r\nsister to get up for _me_.” And in a lower tone to Fanny, “I shall have\r\nonly a desolate house to hurry from.', 'Mr. Crawford was in love with Fanny.', 'After seeing William to the last moment, Fanny walked back to the\r\nbreakfast-room with a very saddened heart to grieve over the melancholy\r\nchange; and there her uncle kindly left her to cry in peace,\r\nconceiving, perhaps, that the deserted chair of each young man might\r\nexercise her tender enthusiasm, and that the remaining cold pork bones\r\nand mustard in William’s plate might but divide her feelings with the\r\nbroken egg-shells in Mr. Crawford’s.', '“She could not recollect what it\r\nwas that she had heard about one of the Miss Maddoxes, or what it was\r\nthat Lady Prescott had noticed in Fanny: she was not sure whether\r\nColonel Harrison had been talking of Mr. Crawford or of William when he\r\nsaid he was the finest young man in the room—somebody had whispered\r\nsomething to her; she had forgot to ask Sir Thomas what it could be.”\r\nAnd these were her longest speeches and clearest communications: the\r\nrest was only a languid “Yes, yes; very well; did you?', 'Fetch the cards; I feel\r\nso very stupid.”\r\n\r\nThe cards were brought, and Fanny played at cribbage with her aunt till\r\nbedtime; and as Sir Thomas was reading to himself, no sounds were heard\r\nin the room for the next two hours beyond the reckonings of the\r\ngame—“And _that_ makes thirty-one; four in hand and eight in crib.', 'You\r\nare to deal, ma’am; shall I deal for you?” Fanny thought and thought\r\nagain of the difference which twenty-four hours had made in that room,\r\nand all that part of the house.', '“We miss our two young men,” was Sir Thomas’s observation on both the\r\nfirst and second day, as they formed their very reduced circle after\r\ndinner; and in consideration of Fanny’s swimming eyes, nothing more was\r\nsaid on the first day than to drink their good health; but on the\r\nsecond it led to something farther.', 'Lady Bertram agreed to it all with a calm “Yes”; and at the end\r\nof a quarter of an hour’s silent consideration spontaneously observed,\r\n“Sir Thomas, I have been thinking—and I am very glad we took Fanny as\r\nwe did, for now the others are away we feel the good of it.”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas immediately improved this compliment by adding, “Very true.', 'We shew Fanny what a good girl we think her by praising her to her\r\nface, she is now a very valuable companion.', 'What was tranquillity and comfort to Fanny was tediousness and vexation\r\nto Mary.', 'To Fanny’s mind,\r\nEdmund’s absence was really, in its cause and its tendency, a relief.', 'It became absolutely necessary\r\nfor her to get to Fanny and try to learn something more.', 'The first half-hour was lost, for Fanny and Lady Bertram were together,\r\nand unless she had Fanny to herself she could hope for nothing.', 'Does his staying longer surprise you?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know,” said Fanny hesitatingly.', 'Two play on the pianoforte, and one on the harp;\r\nand all sing, or would sing if they were taught, or sing all the better\r\nfor not being taught; or something like it.”\r\n\r\n“I know nothing of the Miss Owens,” said Fanny calmly.', 'I shall not be in any\r\ndoubtful, or distant, or unapproachable region.”\r\n\r\nNow Fanny could not bring herself to speak, and Miss Crawford was\r\ndisappointed; for she had hoped to hear some pleasant assurance of her\r\npower from one who she thought must know, and her spirits were clouded\r\nagain.', 'You don’t speak, Fanny; Miss Price, you don’t speak.', 'But\r\nhonestly now, do not you rather expect it than otherwise?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Fanny stoutly, “I do not expect it at all.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all!” cried Miss Crawford with alacrity.', 'But\r\nI dare say you know exactly—I always imagine you are—perhaps you do not\r\nthink him likely to marry at all—or not at present.”\r\n\r\n“No, I do not,” said Fanny softly, hoping she did not err either in the\r\nbelief or the acknowledgment of it.', 'Henry had said he should just\r\ngo and ask the Bertrams how they did, and be back in ten minutes, but\r\nhe was gone above an hour; and when his sister, who had been waiting\r\nfor him to walk with her in the garden, met him at last most\r\nimpatiently in the sweep, and cried out, “My dear Henry, where can you\r\nhave been all this time?” he had only to say that he had been sitting\r\nwith Lady Bertram and Fanny.', 'No: you must be aware that I am\r\nquite determined to marry Fanny Price.”\r\n\r\nThe surprise was now complete; for, in spite of whatever his\r\nconsciousness might suggest, a suspicion of his having any such views\r\nhad never entered his sister’s imagination; and she looked so truly the\r\nastonishment she felt, that he was obliged to repeat what he had said,\r\nand more fully and more solemnly.', '“When Fanny is known to him,” continued Henry, “he will doat on her.', 'From my soul I do not think she would\r\nmarry you _without_ love; that is, if there is a girl in the world\r\ncapable of being uninfluenced by ambition, I can suppose it her; but\r\nask her to love you, and she will never have the heart to refuse.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as her eagerness could rest in silence, he was as happy to tell\r\nas she could be to listen; and a conversation followed almost as deeply\r\ninteresting to her as to himself, though he had in fact nothing to\r\nrelate but his own sensations, nothing to dwell on but Fanny’s charms.', 'Fanny’s beauty of face and figure, Fanny’s graces of manner and\r\ngoodness of heart, were the exhaustless theme.', '“The more I think of it,” she cried, “the more am I convinced that you\r\nare doing quite right; and though I should never have selected Fanny\r\nPrice as the girl most likely to attach you, I am now persuaded she is\r\nthe very one to make you happy.', '“I cannot admit\r\nMrs. Grant to have an equal claim with Fanny and myself, for we shall\r\nboth have a right in you.', 'You\r\nmust not prejudice Fanny against him.', '“Henry, I think so highly of Fanny Price, that if I\r\ncould suppose the next Mrs. Crawford would have half the reason which\r\nmy poor ill-used aunt had to abhor the very name, I would prevent the\r\nmarriage, if possible; but I know you: I know that a wife you _loved_\r\nwould be the happiest of women, and that even when you ceased to love,\r\nshe would yet find in you the liberality and good-breeding of a\r\ngentleman.”\r\n\r\nThe impossibility of not doing everything in the world to make Fanny\r\nPrice happy, or of ceasing to love Fanny Price, was of course the\r\ngroundwork of his eloquent answer.', 'Yes, Mary, my Fanny will feel a\r\ndifference indeed: a daily, hourly difference, in the behaviour of\r\nevery being who approaches her; and it will be the completion of my\r\nhappiness to know that I am the doer of it, that I am the person to\r\ngive the consequence so justly her due.', 'Henry, overjoyed to have her go, bowed and watched her off, and without\r\nlosing another moment, turned instantly to Fanny, and, taking out some\r\nletters, said, with a most animated look, “I must acknowledge myself\r\ninfinitely obliged to any creature who gives me such an opportunity of\r\nseeing you alone: I have been wishing it more than you can have any\r\nidea.', '_Now_ I may say that even I\r\ncould not require William Price to excite a greater interest, or be\r\nfollowed by warmer wishes and higher commendation, than were most\r\nvoluntarily bestowed by my uncle after the evening they had passed\r\ntogether.”\r\n\r\n“Has this been all _your_ doing, then?” cried Fanny.', 'He had communicated it to no creature: he\r\nhad not breathed a syllable of it even to Mary; while uncertain of the\r\nissue, he could not have borne any participation of his feelings, but\r\nthis had been his business; and he spoke with such a glow of what his\r\nsolicitude had been, and used such strong expressions, was so abounding\r\nin the _deepest_ _interest_, in _twofold_ _motives_, in _views_ _and_\r\n_wishes_ _more_ _than_ _could_ _be_ _told_, that Fanny could not have\r\nremained insensible of his drift, had she been able to attend; but her\r\nheart was so full and her senses still so astonished, that she could\r\nlisten but imperfectly even to what he told her of William, and saying\r\nonly when he paused, “How kind!', 'Go on, my dear Fanny, and without fear; there can\r\nbe no difficulties worth naming.', 'Yours affectionately,\r\nM. C.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThese were not expressions to do Fanny any good; for though she read in\r\ntoo much haste and confusion to form the clearest judgment of Miss\r\nCrawford’s meaning, it was evident that she meant to compliment her on\r\nher brother’s attachment, and even to _appear_ to believe it serious.', 'I think I\r\nwill have two shawls, Fanny.”\r\n\r\nFanny, meanwhile, speaking only when she could not help it, was very\r\nearnestly trying to understand what Mr. and Miss Crawford were at.', 'At last—it seemed an at last to Fanny’s nervousness, though not\r\nremarkably late—he began to talk of going away; but the comfort of the\r\nsound was impaired by his turning to her the next moment, and saying,\r\n“Have you nothing to send to Mary?', 'certainly,” cried Fanny, rising in haste, the haste of\r\nembarrassment and of wanting to get away—“I will write directly.”\r\n\r\nShe went accordingly to the table, where she was in the habit of\r\nwriting for her aunt, and prepared her materials without knowing what\r\nin the world to say.', 'I am\r\naware that there has been sometimes, in some points, a misplaced\r\ndistinction; but I think too well of you, Fanny, to suppose you will\r\never harbour resentment on that account.', 'Mr. Crawford’s business had been to declare himself the lover of Fanny,\r\nmake decided proposals for her, and entreat the sanction of the uncle,\r\nwho seemed to stand in the place of her parents; and he had done it all\r\nso well, so openly, so liberally, so properly, that Sir Thomas,\r\nfeeling, moreover, his own replies, and his own remarks to have been\r\nvery much to the purpose, was exceedingly happy to give the particulars\r\nof their conversation; and little aware of what was passing in his\r\nniece’s mind, conceived that by such details he must be gratifying her\r\nfar more than himself.', 'He talked, therefore, for several minutes\r\nwithout Fanny’s daring to interrupt him.', 'For a\r\nmoment he ceased, but she had barely become conscious of it, when,\r\nrising from his chair, he said, “And now, Fanny, having performed one\r\npart of my commission, and shewn you everything placed on a basis the\r\nmost assured and satisfactory, I may execute the remainder by\r\nprevailing on you to accompany me downstairs, where, though I cannot\r\nbut presume on having been no unacceptable companion myself, I must\r\nsubmit to your finding one still better worth listening to.', 'But now, when he has made his overtures so\r\nproperly, and honourably—what are your scruples _now_?”\r\n\r\n“You are mistaken, sir,” cried Fanny, forced by the anxiety of the\r\nmoment even to tell her uncle that he was wrong; “you are quite\r\nmistaken.', 'He has done it already.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Fanny, in a faint voice, and looking down with fresh shame;\r\nand she did feel almost ashamed of herself, after such a picture as her\r\nuncle had drawn, for not liking Mr. Crawford.', 'I am half inclined to think, Fanny, that you do not\r\nquite know your own feelings.”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, sir!', 'I wish he were more\r\nlikely to fix.” Here was a glance at Fanny.', 'But the removal of his alarm did his niece no\r\nservice: as her unaccountableness was confirmed his displeasure\r\nincreased; and getting up and walking about the room with a frown,\r\nwhich Fanny could picture to herself, though she dared not lift up her\r\neyes, he shortly afterwards, and in a voice of authority, said, “Have\r\nyou any reason, child, to think ill of Mr. Crawford’s temper?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir.”\r\n\r\nShe longed to add, “But of his principles I have”; but her heart sunk\r\nunder the appalling prospect of discussion, explanation, and probably\r\nnon-conviction.', 'For I _had_, Fanny, as I think my behaviour must have\r\nshewn, formed a very favourable opinion of you from the period of my\r\nreturn to England.', 'Here is a\r\nyoung man of sense, of character, of temper, of manners, and of\r\nfortune, exceedingly attached to you, and seeking your hand in the most\r\nhandsome and disinterested way; and let me tell you, Fanny, that you\r\nmay live eighteen years longer in the world without being addressed by\r\na man of half Mr. Crawford’s estate, or a tenth part of his merits.', 'But, Fanny, if\r\nyour heart can acquit you of _ingratitude_—”\r\n\r\nHe ceased.', 'I am totally unequal to it.”\r\n\r\nBut Fanny shewed such reluctance, such misery, at the idea of going\r\ndown to him, that Sir Thomas, after a little consideration, judged it\r\nbetter to indulge her.', 'Upon my\r\nrepresentation of what you were suffering, he immediately, and with the\r\ngreatest delicacy, ceased to urge to see you for the present.”\r\n\r\nHere Fanny, who had looked up, looked down again.', 'And, Fanny” (turning back again for a moment), “I\r\nshall make no mention below of what has passed; I shall not even tell\r\nyour aunt Bertram.', 'There is no occasion for spreading the\r\ndisappointment; say nothing about it yourself.”\r\n\r\nThis was an order to be most joyfully obeyed; this was an act of\r\nkindness which Fanny felt at her heart.', 'It would have made no difference to you, I suppose,\r\nwhether you had walked in the shrubbery or gone to my house.”\r\n\r\n“I recommended the shrubbery to Fanny as the driest place,” said Sir\r\nThomas.', 'If she would but have let us know she was going out but there is\r\na something about Fanny, I have often observed it before—she likes to\r\ngo her own way to work; she does not like to be dictated to; she takes\r\nher own independent walk whenever she can; she certainly has a little\r\nspirit of secrecy, and independence, and nonsense, about her, which I\r\nwould advise her to get the better of.”\r\n\r\nAs a general reflection on Fanny, Sir Thomas thought nothing could be\r\nmore unjust, though he had been so lately expressing the same\r\nsentiments himself, and he tried to turn the conversation: tried\r\nrepeatedly before he could succeed; for Mrs. Norris had not discernment\r\nenough to perceive, either now, or at any other time, to what degree he\r\nthought well of his niece, or how very far he was from wishing to have\r\nhis own children’s merits set off by the depreciation of hers.', 'She was\r\ntalking _at_ Fanny, and resenting this private walk half through the\r\ndinner.', 'It was over, however, at last; and the evening set in with more\r\ncomposure to Fanny, and more cheerfulness of spirits than she could\r\nhave hoped for after so stormy a morning; but she trusted, in the first\r\nplace, that she had done right: that her judgment had not misled her.', 'While Fanny’s mind was engaged in these sort of hopes, her uncle was,\r\nsoon after tea, called out of the room; an occurrence too common to\r\nstrike her, and she thought nothing of it till the butler reappeared\r\nten minutes afterwards, and advancing decidedly towards herself, said,\r\n“Sir Thomas wishes to speak with you, ma’am, in his own room.” Then it\r\noccurred to her what might be going on; a suspicion rushed over her\r\nmind which drove the colour from her cheeks; but instantly rising, she\r\nwas preparing to obey, when Mrs. Norris called out, “Stay, stay, Fanny!', '“No, ma’am, it is Miss Price; I am certain of\r\nits being Miss Price.” And there was a half-smile with the words, which\r\nmeant, “I do not think you would answer the purpose at all.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris, much discontented, was obliged to compose herself to work\r\nagain; and Fanny, walking off in agitating consciousness, found\r\nherself, as she anticipated, in another minute alone with Mr. Crawford.', 'To Fanny, however, who had known too much opposition all her life to\r\nfind any charm in it, all this was unintelligible.', 'The effect of the\r\nwhole was a manner so pitying and agitated, and words intermingled with\r\nher refusal so expressive of obligation and concern, that to a temper\r\nof vanity and hope like Crawford’s, the truth, or at least the strength\r\nof her indifference, might well be questionable; and he was not so\r\nirrational as Fanny considered him, in the professions of persevering,\r\nassiduous, and not desponding attachment which closed the interview.', 'So thought Fanny, in good truth and sober sadness, as she sat musing\r\nover that too great indulgence and luxury of a fire upstairs: wondering\r\nat the past and present; wondering at what was yet to come, and in a\r\nnervous agitation which made nothing clear to her but the persuasion of\r\nher being never under any circumstances able to love Mr. Crawford, and\r\nthe felicity of having a fire to sit over and think of it.', 'The first feeling was\r\ndisappointment: he had hoped better things; he had thought that an\r\nhour’s entreaty from a young man like Crawford could not have worked so\r\nlittle change on a gentle-tempered girl like Fanny; but there was\r\nspeedy comfort in the determined views and sanguine perseverance of the\r\nlover; and when seeing such confidence of success in the principal, Sir\r\nThomas was soon able to depend on it himself.', 'Accordingly, on this principle,\r\nSir Thomas took the first opportunity of saying to her, with a mild\r\ngravity, intended to be overcoming, “Well, Fanny, I have seen Mr.\r\nCrawford again, and learn from him exactly how matters stand between\r\nyou.', 'Had his choice been less unexceptionable, I should\r\nhave condemned his persevering.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, sir,” said Fanny, “I am very sorry that Mr. Crawford should\r\ncontinue to—I know that it is paying me a very great compliment, and I\r\nfeel most undeservedly honoured; but I am so perfectly convinced, and I\r\nhave told him so, that it never will be in my power—”\r\n\r\n“My dear,” interrupted Sir Thomas, “there is no occasion for this.', 'And now, my dear\r\nFanny, this subject is closed between us.”\r\n\r\nThe promised departure was all that Fanny could think of with much\r\nsatisfaction.', 'When Sir Thomas understood this, he felt the necessity\r\nof making his own wife and sister-in-law acquainted with the business\r\nwithout delay; though, on Fanny’s account, he almost dreaded the effect\r\nof the communication to Mrs. Norris as much as Fanny herself.', 'Angry she was:\r\nbitterly angry; but she was more angry with Fanny for having received\r\nsuch an offer than for refusing it.', 'It was an injury and affront to\r\nJulia, who ought to have been Mr. Crawford’s choice; and, independently\r\nof that, she disliked Fanny, because she had neglected her; and she\r\nwould have grudged such an elevation to one whom she had been always\r\ntrying to depress.', 'Sir Thomas gave her more credit for discretion on the occasion than she\r\ndeserved; and Fanny could have blessed her for allowing her only to see\r\nher displeasure, and not to hear it.', 'To know Fanny to be sought in marriage by a man of\r\nfortune, raised her, therefore, very much in her opinion.', 'By convincing\r\nher that Fanny _was_ very pretty, which she had been doubting about\r\nbefore, and that she would be advantageously married, it made her feel\r\na sort of credit in calling her niece.', '“Well, Fanny,” said she, as soon as they were alone together\r\nafterwards, and she really had known something like impatience to be\r\nalone with her, and her countenance, as she spoke, had extraordinary\r\nanimation; “Well, Fanny, I have had a very agreeable surprise this\r\nmorning.', 'And you must be\r\naware, Fanny, that it is every young woman’s duty to accept such a very\r\nunexceptionable offer as this.”\r\n\r\nThis was almost the only rule of conduct, the only piece of advice,\r\nwhich Fanny had ever received from her aunt in the course of eight\r\nyears and a half.', '“I will tell you what, Fanny,” said she, “I am sure he fell in love\r\nwith you at the ball; I am sure the mischief was done that evening.', 'I shall tell Sir Thomas that I am sure it was done that\r\nevening.” And still pursuing the same cheerful thoughts, she soon\r\nafterwards added, “And I will tell you what, Fanny, which is more than\r\nI did for Maria: the next time Pug has a litter you shall have a\r\npuppy.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nEdmund had great things to hear on his return.', 'After dinner, when he and his father were alone, he had Fanny’s\r\nhistory; and then all the great events of the last fortnight, and the\r\npresent situation of matters at Mansfield were known to him.', 'Meanwhile, he saw enough of Fanny’s embarrassment to make him\r\nscrupulously guard against exciting it a second time, by any word, or\r\nlook, or movement.', 'He staid of course, and Edmund had\r\nthen ample opportunity for observing how he sped with Fanny, and what\r\ndegree of immediate encouragement for him might be extracted from her\r\nmanners; and it was so little, so very, very little—every chance, every\r\npossibility of it, resting upon her embarrassment only; if there was\r\nnot hope in her confusion, there was hope in nothing else—that he was\r\nalmost ready to wonder at his friend’s perseverance.', 'When he and Crawford walked into the drawing-room, his\r\nmother and Fanny were sitting as intently and silently at work as if\r\nthere were nothing else to care for.', '“She often\r\nreads to me out of those books; and she was in the middle of a very\r\nfine speech of that man’s—what’s his name, Fanny?—when we heard your\r\nfootsteps.”\r\n\r\nCrawford took the volume.', 'His\r\nacting had first taught Fanny what pleasure a play might give, and his\r\nreading brought all his acting before her again; nay, perhaps with\r\ngreater enjoyment, for it came unexpectedly, and with no such drawback\r\nas she had been used to suffer in seeing him on the stage with Miss\r\nBertram.', 'Then she was shrinking again into\r\nherself, and blushing and working as hard as ever; but it had been\r\nenough to give Edmund encouragement for his friend, and as he cordially\r\nthanked him, he hoped to be expressing Fanny’s secret feelings too.', 'Both gentlemen had a glance at Fanny, to see if a word of accordant\r\npraise could be extorted from her; yet both feeling that it could not\r\nbe.', 'Oh no!” And\r\nhe looked at Fanny with an expressive smile, which evidently meant,\r\n“That lady will never allow a theatre at Everingham.”\r\n\r\nEdmund saw it all, and saw Fanny so determined _not_ to see it, as to\r\nmake it clear that the voice was enough to convey the full meaning of\r\nthe protestation; and such a quick consciousness of compliment, such a\r\nready comprehension of a hint, he thought, was rather favourable than\r\nnot.', 'The two young men\r\nwere the only talkers, but they, standing by the fire, talked over the\r\ntoo common neglect of the qualification, the total inattention to it,\r\nin the ordinary school-system for boys, the consequently natural, yet\r\nin some instances almost unnatural, degree of ignorance and uncouthness\r\nof men, of sensible and well-informed men, when suddenly called to the\r\nnecessity of reading aloud, which had fallen within their notice,\r\ngiving instances of blunders, and failures with their secondary causes,\r\nthe want of management of the voice, of proper modulation and emphasis,\r\nof foresight and judgment, all proceeding from the first cause: want of\r\nearly attention and habit; and Fanny was listening again with great\r\nentertainment.', 'It is felt that distinctness and\r\nenergy may have weight in recommending the most solid truths; and\r\nbesides, there is more general observation and taste, a more critical\r\nknowledge diffused than formerly; in every congregation there is a\r\nlarger proportion who know a little of the matter, and who can judge\r\nand criticise.”\r\n\r\nEdmund had already gone through the service once since his ordination;\r\nand upon this being understood, he had a variety of questions from\r\nCrawford as to his feelings and success; questions, which being made,\r\nthough with the vivacity of friendly interest and quick taste, without\r\nany touch of that spirit of banter or air of levity which Edmund knew\r\nto be most offensive to Fanny, he had true pleasure in satisfying; and\r\nwhen Crawford proceeded to ask his opinion and give his own as to the\r\nproperest manner in which particular passages in the service should be\r\ndelivered, shewing it to be a subject on which he had thought before,\r\nand thought with judgment, Edmund was still more and more pleased.', 'This\r\nwould be the way to Fanny’s heart.', 'For myself, at least, I must confess being not always so attentive as I\r\nought to be” (here was a glance at Fanny); “that nineteen times out of\r\ntwenty I am thinking how such a prayer ought to be read, and longing to\r\nhave it to read myself.', 'Did you speak?” stepping eagerly to Fanny, and\r\naddressing her in a softened voice; and upon her saying “No,” he added,\r\n“Are you sure you did not speak?', 'And I do not know that I should be fond of\r\npreaching often; now and then, perhaps once or twice in the spring,\r\nafter being anxiously expected for half a dozen Sundays together; but\r\nnot for a constancy; it would not do for a constancy.”\r\n\r\nHere Fanny, who could not but listen, involuntarily shook her head, and\r\nCrawford was instantly by her side again, entreating to know her\r\nmeaning; and as Edmund perceived, by his drawing in a chair, and\r\nsitting down close by her, that it was to be a very thorough attack,\r\nthat looks and undertones were to be well tried, he sank as quietly as\r\npossible into a corner, turned his back, and took up a newspaper, very\r\nsincerely wishing that dear little Fanny might be persuaded into\r\nexplaining away that shake of the head to the satisfaction of her\r\nardent lover; and as earnestly trying to bury every sound of the\r\nbusiness from himself in murmurs of his own, over the various\r\nadvertisements of “A most desirable Estate in South Wales”; “To Parents\r\nand Guardians”; and a “Capital season’d Hunter.”\r\n\r\nFanny, meanwhile, vexed with herself for not having been as motionless\r\nas she was speechless, and grieved to the heart to see Edmund’s\r\narrangements, was trying by everything in the power of her modest,\r\ngentle nature, to repulse Mr. Crawford, and avoid both his looks and\r\ninquiries; and he, unrepulsable, was persisting in both.', 'Did\r\nyou think I ought?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps, sir,” said Fanny, wearied at last into speaking—“perhaps,\r\nsir, I thought it was a pity you did not always know yourself as well\r\nas you seemed to do at that moment.”\r\n\r\nCrawford, delighted to get her to speak at any rate, was determined to\r\nkeep it up; and poor Fanny, who had hoped to silence him by such an\r\nextremity of reproof, found herself sadly mistaken, and that it was\r\nonly a change from one object of curiosity and one set of words to\r\nanother.', 'Yes, dearest, sweetest Fanny.', 'But though the conference had seemed full long to\r\nhim, and though on looking at Fanny he saw rather a flush of vexation,\r\nhe inclined to hope that so much could not have been said and listened\r\nto without some profit to the speaker.', 'CHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\n\r\nEdmund had determined that it belonged entirely to Fanny to chuse\r\nwhether her situation with regard to Crawford should be mentioned\r\nbetween them or not; and that if she did not lead the way, it should\r\nnever be touched on by him; but after a day or two of mutual reserve,\r\nhe was induced by his father to change his mind, and try what his\r\ninfluence might do for his friend.', 'Edmund was not unwilling to be persuaded to engage in the business; he\r\nwanted to know Fanny’s feelings.', '“I am come to walk with you, Fanny,” said he.', '“But, Fanny,” he presently added, “in order to have a comfortable walk,\r\nsomething more is necessary than merely pacing this gravel together.', 'Am I to\r\nhear of it from everybody but Fanny herself?”\r\n\r\nFanny, at once agitated and dejected, replied, “If you hear of it from\r\neverybody, cousin, there can be nothing for me to tell.”\r\n\r\n“Not of facts, perhaps; but of feelings, Fanny.', 'This is such a comfort!”\r\n\r\n“This comfort you might have had sooner, Fanny, had you sought it.', 'Were I even careless in general\r\non such matters, how could you imagine me so where your happiness was\r\nat stake?”\r\n\r\n“My uncle thought me wrong, and I knew he had been talking to you.”\r\n\r\n“As far as you have gone, Fanny, I think you perfectly right.', 'But” (with an affectionate smile) “let him\r\nsucceed at last, Fanny, let him succeed at last.', 'I wish he had\r\nknown you as well as I do, Fanny.', 'You must be sorry for your own\r\nindifference.”\r\n\r\n“We are so totally unlike,” said Fanny, avoiding a direct answer, “we\r\nare so very, very different in all our inclinations and ways, that I\r\nconsider it as quite impossible we should ever be tolerably happy\r\ntogether, even if I _could_ like him.', 'We should be miserable.”\r\n\r\n“You are mistaken, Fanny.', 'You have both warm hearts and benevolent\r\nfeelings; and, Fanny, who that heard him read, and saw you listen to\r\nShakespeare the other night, will think you unfitted as companions?', 'Your\r\nbeing so far unlike, Fanny, does not in the smallest degree make\r\nagainst the probability of your happiness together: do not imagine it.', 'A counteraction, gentle and\r\ncontinual, is the best safeguard of manners and conduct.”\r\n\r\nFull well could Fanny guess where his thoughts were now: Miss\r\nCrawford’s power was all returning.', 'After leaving him to his happier thoughts for some minutes, Fanny,\r\nfeeling it due to herself, returned to Mr. Crawford, and said, “It is\r\nnot merely in _temper_ that I consider him as totally unsuited to\r\nmyself; though, in _that_ respect, I think the difference between us\r\ntoo great, infinitely too great: his spirits often oppress me; but\r\nthere is something in him which I object to still more.', 'I then saw him behaving, as it appeared\r\nto me, so very improperly and unfeelingly—I may speak of it now because\r\nit is all over—so improperly by poor Mr. Rushworth, not seeming to care\r\nhow he exposed or hurt him, and paying attentions to my cousin Maria,\r\nwhich—in short, at the time of the play, I received an impression which\r\nwill never be got over.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Fanny,” replied Edmund, scarcely hearing her to the end, “let\r\nus not, any of us, be judged by what we appeared at that period of\r\ngeneral folly.', 'I was playing the fool with my eyes open.”\r\n\r\n“As a bystander,” said Fanny, “perhaps I saw more than you did; and I\r\ndo think that Mr. Rushworth was sometimes very jealous.”\r\n\r\n“Very possibly.', 'And, Fanny, though I hope\r\nI do justice to my sisters’ good qualities, I think it very possible\r\nthat they might, one or both, be more desirous of being admired by\r\nCrawford, and might shew that desire rather more unguardedly than was\r\nperfectly prudent.', 'He will make you happy, Fanny; I know he will make you happy; but you\r\nwill make him everything.”\r\n\r\n“I would not engage in such a charge,” cried Fanny, in a shrinking\r\naccent; “in such an office of high responsibility!”\r\n\r\n“As usual, believing yourself unequal to anything!', 'Next to your happiness, Fanny, his has the first\r\nclaim on me.', 'She spoke of you, Fanny, just as she ought.', 'She is very angry with you, Fanny; you must\r\nbe prepared for that.', 'She is hurt, as you would be for William; but she loves and\r\nesteems you with all her heart.”\r\n\r\n“I knew she would be very angry with me.”\r\n\r\n“My dearest Fanny,” cried Edmund, pressing her arm closer to him, “do\r\nnot let the idea of her anger distress you.', 'The surprise of your\r\nrefusal, Fanny, seems to have been unbounded.', 'Do not turn away from me.”\r\n\r\n“I _should_ have thought,” said Fanny, after a pause of recollection\r\nand exertion, “that every woman must have felt the possibility of a\r\nman’s not being approved, not being loved by some one of her sex at\r\nleast, let him be ever so generally agreeable.', 'And,\r\nand—we think very differently of the nature of women, if they can\r\nimagine a woman so very soon capable of returning an affection as this\r\nseems to imply.”\r\n\r\n“My dear, dear Fanny, now I have the truth.', 'But I am\r\nspoilt, Fanny, for common female society.', 'You and Miss Crawford have made me\r\ntoo nice.”\r\n\r\nStill, however, Fanny was oppressed and wearied; he saw it in her\r\nlooks, it could not be talked away; and attempting it no more, he led\r\nher directly, with the kind authority of a privileged guardian, into\r\nthe house.', 'CHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nEdmund now believed himself perfectly acquainted with all that Fanny\r\ncould tell, or could leave to be conjectured of her sentiments, and he\r\nwas satisfied.', 'Edmund’s account of Fanny’s\r\ndisposition he could believe to be just; he supposed she had all those\r\nfeelings, but he must consider it as very unfortunate that she _had_;\r\nfor, less willing than his son to trust to the future, he could not\r\nhelp fearing that if such very long allowances of time and habit were\r\nnecessary for her, she might not have persuaded herself into receiving\r\nhis addresses properly before the young man’s inclination for paying\r\nthem were over.', 'The promised visit from “her friend,” as Edmund called Miss Crawford,\r\nwas a formidable threat to Fanny, and she lived in continual terror of\r\nit.', 'Her displeasure, her\r\npenetration, and her happiness were all fearful to encounter; and the\r\ndependence of having others present when they met was Fanny’s only\r\nsupport in looking forward to it.', 'She was safe in the breakfast-room, with her aunt, when\r\nMiss Crawford did come; and the first misery over, and Miss Crawford\r\nlooking and speaking with much less particularity of expression than\r\nshe had anticipated, Fanny began to hope there would be nothing worse\r\nto be endured than a half-hour of moderate agitation.', 'She was\r\ndetermined to see Fanny alone, and therefore said to her tolerably\r\nsoon, in a low voice, “I must speak to you for a few minutes\r\nsomewhere”; words that Fanny felt all over her, in all her pulses and\r\nall her nerves.', 'She immediately shook her head at Fanny\r\nwith arch, yet affectionate reproach, and taking her hand, seemed\r\nhardly able to help beginning directly.', 'Say what you would, Fanny, it should be _that_;\r\nfor I never knew such exquisite happiness in any other.', 'Yet, Fanny,\r\ndo not imagine I would now speak disrespectfully of Sir Thomas, though\r\nI certainly did hate him for many a week.', 'Nay, in sober\r\nsadness, I believe I now love you all.” And having said so, with a\r\ndegree of tenderness and consciousness which Fanny had never seen in\r\nher before, and now thought only too becoming, she turned away for a\r\nmoment to recover herself.', '“I have had a little fit since I came into\r\nthis room, as you may perceive,” said she presently, with a playful\r\nsmile, “but it is over now; so let us sit down and be comfortable; for\r\nas to scolding you, Fanny, which I came fully intending to do, I have\r\nnot the heart for it when it comes to the point.” And embracing her\r\nvery affectionately, “Good, gentle Fanny!', 'And when I have done with her I must go to her sister, Lady\r\nStornaway, because _she_ was rather my most particular friend of the\r\ntwo, but I have not cared much for _her_ these three years.”\r\n\r\nAfter this speech the two girls sat many minutes silent, each\r\nthoughtful: Fanny meditating on the different sorts of friendship in\r\nthe world, Mary on something of less philosophic tendency.', '“Why, Fanny, you are absolutely in a reverie.', 'I shall be at Mansfield for ever, Fanny.', 'I have not so much to say for my friend Flora, who jilted a\r\nvery nice young man in the Blues for the sake of that horrid Lord\r\nStornaway, who has about as much sense, Fanny, as Mr. Rushworth, but\r\nmuch worse-looking, and with a blackguard character.', 'It is you, only you, insensible Fanny, who can\r\nthink of him with anything like indifference.', 'No, no, I see you are not.”\r\n\r\nThere was, indeed, so deep a blush over Fanny’s face at that moment as\r\nmight warrant strong suspicion in a predisposed mind.', 'But, dear Fanny, you must allow that you were not so absolutely\r\nunprepared to have the question asked as your cousin fancies.', 'I am\r\nashamed to say that it had never entered my head, but I was delighted\r\nto act on his proposal for both your sakes.”\r\n\r\n“I will not say,” replied Fanny, “that I was not half afraid at the\r\ntime of its being so, for there was something in your look that\r\nfrightened me, but not at first; I was as unsuspicious of it at\r\nfirst—indeed, indeed I was.', 'And then, Fanny, the glory of fixing one\r\nwho has been shot at by so many; of having it in one’s power to pay off\r\nthe debts of one’s sex!', '“I cannot imagine Henry ever to have been happier,” continued Mary\r\npresently, “than when he had succeeded in getting your brother’s\r\ncommission.”\r\n\r\nShe had made a sure push at Fanny’s feelings here.', 'I wish we could see him.”\r\n\r\nPoor Fanny’s mind was thrown into the most distressing of all its\r\nvarieties.', 'The recollection of what had been done for William was\r\nalways the most powerful disturber of every decision against Mr.\r\nCrawford; and she sat thinking deeply of it till Mary, who had been\r\nfirst watching her complacently, and then musing on something else,\r\nsuddenly called her attention by saying: “I should like to sit talking\r\nwith you here all day, but we must not forget the ladies below, and so\r\ngood-bye, my dear, my amiable, my excellent Fanny, for though we shall\r\nnominally part in the breakfast-parlour, I must take leave of you here.', 'I have two favours to\r\nask, Fanny: one is your correspondence.', 'And the\r\nother, that you will often call on Mrs. Grant, and make her amends for\r\nmy being gone.”\r\n\r\nThe first, at least, of these favours Fanny would rather not have been\r\nasked; but it was impossible for her to refuse the correspondence; it\r\nwas impossible for her even not to accede to it more readily than her\r\nown judgment authorised.', 'He was evidently oppressed, and Fanny must\r\ngrieve for him, though hoping she might never see him again till he\r\nwere the husband of some other woman.', 'He wondered that Fanny spoke so seldom of _her_, and had so\r\nlittle voluntarily to say of her concern at this separation.', 'it was this sister, this friend and companion, who was now the\r\nchief bane of Fanny’s comfort.', 'He was to go to town as soon as\r\nsome business relative to Thornton Lacey were completed—perhaps within\r\na fortnight; he talked of going, he loved to talk of it; and when once\r\nwith her again, Fanny could not doubt the rest.', 'But\r\nas such were Fanny’s persuasions, she suffered very much from them, and\r\ncould never speak of Miss Crawford without pain.', 'Had Fanny been at all addicted to raptures, she must have had a strong\r\nattack of them when she first understood what was intended, when her\r\nuncle first made her the offer of visiting the parents, and brothers,\r\nand sisters, from whom she had been divided almost half her life; of\r\nreturning for a couple of months to the scenes of her infancy, with\r\nWilliam for the protector and companion of her journey, and the\r\ncertainty of continuing to see William to the last hour of his\r\nremaining on land.', 'When he had really resolved on any\r\nmeasure, he could always carry it through; and now by dint of long\r\ntalking on the subject, explaining and dwelling on the duty of Fanny’s\r\nsometimes seeing her family, he did induce his wife to let her go;\r\nobtaining it rather from submission, however, than conviction, for Lady\r\nBertram was convinced of very little more than that Sir Thomas thought\r\nFanny ought to go, and therefore that she must.', 'In the calmness of her\r\nown dressing-room, in the impartial flow of her own meditations,\r\nunbiassed by his bewildering statements, she could not acknowledge any\r\nnecessity for Fanny’s ever going near a father and mother who had done\r\nwithout her so long, while she was so useful to herself.', 'But Mrs. Norris wanted to persuade her that Fanny could be\r\nvery well spared—_she_ being ready to give up all her own time to her\r\nas requested—and, in short, could not really be wanted or missed.', 'How right and comfortable it will all be!”\r\n\r\nBy the time Mrs. Price’s answer arrived, there remained but a very few\r\ndays more to be spent at Mansfield; and for part of one of those days\r\nthe young travellers were in a good deal of alarm on the subject of\r\ntheir journey, for when the mode of it came to be talked of, and Mrs.\r\nNorris found that all her anxiety to save her brother-in-law’s money\r\nwas vain, and that in spite of her wishes and hints for a less\r\nexpensive conveyance of Fanny, they were to travel post; when she saw\r\nSir Thomas actually give William notes for the purpose, she was struck\r\nwith the idea of there being room for a third in the carriage, and\r\nsuddenly seized with a strong inclination to go with them, to go and\r\nsee her poor dear sister Price.', 'William and Fanny were horror-struck at the idea.', 'Edmund’s plans were affected by this Portsmouth journey, this absence\r\nof Fanny’s.', 'He told Fanny of it.', 'It made the substance of one other confidential discourse\r\nabout Miss Crawford; and Fanny was the more affected from feeling it to\r\nbe the last time in which Miss Crawford’s name would ever be mentioned\r\nbetween them with any remains of liberty.', 'Lady Bertram had been telling her niece in the\r\nevening to write to her soon and often, and promising to be a good\r\ncorrespondent herself; and Edmund, at a convenient moment, then added\r\nin a whisper, “And _I_ shall write to you, Fanny, when I have anything\r\nworth writing about, anything to say that I think you will like to\r\nhear, and that you will not hear so soon from any other quarter.” Had\r\nshe doubted his meaning while she listened, the glow in his face, when\r\nshe looked up at him, would have been decisive.', 'Poor Fanny!', 'All this passed overnight, for the journey was to begin very early in\r\nthe morning; and when the small, diminished party met at breakfast,\r\nWilliam and Fanny were talked of as already advanced one stage.', 'CHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe novelty of travelling, and the happiness of being with William,\r\nsoon produced their natural effect on Fanny’s spirits, when Mansfield\r\nPark was fairly left behind; and by the time their first stage was\r\nended, and they were to quit Sir Thomas’s carriage, she was able to\r\ntake leave of the old coachman, and send back proper messages, with\r\ncheerful looks.', 'Everything supplied an amusement to the high glee of William’s mind,\r\nand he was full of frolic and joke in the intervals of their\r\nhigher-toned subjects, all of which ended, if they did not begin, in\r\npraise of the Thrush, conjectures how she would be employed, schemes\r\nfor an action with some superior force, which (supposing the first\r\nlieutenant out of the way, and William was not very merciful to the\r\nfirst lieutenant) was to give himself the next step as soon as\r\npossible, or speculations upon prize-money, which was to be generously\r\ndistributed at home, with only the reservation of enough to make the\r\nlittle cottage comfortable, in which he and Fanny were to pass all\r\ntheir middle and later life together.', 'It was a correspondence which Fanny found quite as unpleasant as she\r\nhad feared.', 'There had, in fact, been so much of message, of allusion, of\r\nrecollection, so much of Mansfield in every letter, that Fanny could\r\nnot but suppose it meant for him to hear; and to find herself forced\r\ninto a purpose of that kind, compelled into a correspondence which was\r\nbringing her the addresses of the man she did not love, and obliging\r\nher to administer to the adverse passion of the man she did, was\r\ncruelly mortifying.', 'With such thoughts as these, among ten hundred others, Fanny proceeded\r\nin her journey safely and cheerfully, and as expeditiously as could\r\nrationally be hoped in the dirty month of February.', 'The next morning saw them off again at an early hour; and with no\r\nevents, and no delays, they regularly advanced, and were in the\r\nenvirons of Portsmouth while there was yet daylight for Fanny to look\r\naround her, and wonder at the new buildings.', 'And Mr.\r\nCampbell was here at four o’clock to ask for you: he has got one of the\r\nThrush’s boats, and is going off to her at six, and hoped you would be\r\nhere in time to go with him.”\r\n\r\nA stare or two at Fanny, as William helped her out of the carriage, was\r\nall the voluntary notice which this brother bestowed; but he made no\r\nobjection to her kissing him, though still entirely engaged in\r\ndetailing farther particulars of the Thrush’s going out of harbour, in\r\nwhich he had a strong right of interest, being to commence his career\r\nof seamanship in her at this very time.', 'Another moment and Fanny was in the narrow entrance-passage of the\r\nhouse, and in her mother’s arms, who met her there with looks of true\r\nkindness, and with features which Fanny loved the more, because they\r\nbrought her aunt Bertram’s before her, and there were her two sisters:\r\nSusan, a well-grown fine girl of fourteen, and Betsey, the youngest of\r\nthe family, about five—both glad to see her in their way, though with\r\nno advantage of manner in receiving her.', 'But manner Fanny did not want.', 'But no\r\nmatter; here’s Fanny in the parlour, and why should we stay in the\r\npassage?', 'Come, mother, you have hardly looked at your own dear Fanny\r\nyet.”\r\n\r\nIn they both came, and Mrs. Price having kindly kissed her daughter\r\nagain, and commented a little on her growth, began with very natural\r\nsolicitude to feel for their fatigues and wants as travellers.', 'Susan, you should have taken\r\ncare of the fire.”\r\n\r\n“I was upstairs, mama, moving my things,” said Susan, in a fearless,\r\nself-defending tone, which startled Fanny.', '“You know you had but just\r\nsettled that my sister Fanny and I should have the other room; and I\r\ncould not get Rebecca to give me any help.”\r\n\r\nFarther discussion was prevented by various bustles: first, the driver\r\ncame to be paid; then there was a squabble between Sam and Rebecca\r\nabout the manner of carrying up his sister’s trunk, which he would\r\nmanage all his own way; and lastly, in walked Mr. Price himself, his\r\nown loud voice preceding him, as with something of the oath kind he\r\nkicked away his son’s portmanteau and his daughter’s bandbox in the\r\npassage, and called out for a candle; no candle was brought, however,\r\nand he walked into the room.', 'Fanny\r\nshrunk back to her seat, with feelings sadly pained by his language and\r\nhis smell of spirits; and he talked on only to his son, and only of the\r\nThrush, though William, warmly interested as he was in that subject,\r\nmore than once tried to make his father think of Fanny, and her long\r\nabsence and long journey.', 'Charles had been born since Fanny’s\r\ngoing away, but Tom she had often helped to nurse, and now felt a\r\nparticular pleasure in seeing again.', 'Sam, stop your\r\nconfounded pipe, or I shall be after you.”\r\n\r\nThis threat was so palpably disregarded, that though within five\r\nminutes afterwards the three boys all burst into the room together and\r\nsat down, Fanny could not consider it as a proof of anything more than\r\ntheir being for the time thoroughly fagged, which their hot faces and\r\npanting breaths seemed to prove, especially as they were still kicking\r\neach other’s shins, and hallooing out at sudden starts immediately\r\nunder their father’s eye.', 'Susan and an attendant girl, whose inferior appearance\r\ninformed Fanny, to her great surprise, that she had previously seen the\r\nupper servant, brought in everything necessary for the meal; Susan\r\nlooking, as she put the kettle on the fire and glanced at her sister,\r\nas if divided between the agreeable triumph of shewing her activity and\r\nusefulness, and the dread of being thought to demean herself by such an\r\noffice.', 'Susan had an open,\r\nsensible countenance; she was like William, and Fanny hoped to find her\r\nlike him in disposition and goodwill towards herself.', 'He, complete in his lieutenant’s\r\nuniform, looking and moving all the taller, firmer, and more graceful\r\nfor it, and with the happiest smile over his face, walked up directly\r\nto Fanny, who, rising from her seat, looked at him for a moment in\r\nspeechless admiration, and then threw her arms round his neck to sob\r\nout her various emotions of pain and pleasure.', 'The Bertrams were all forgotten\r\nin detailing the faults of Rebecca, against whom Susan had also much to\r\ndepose, and little Betsey a great deal more, and who did seem so\r\nthoroughly without a single recommendation, that Fanny could not help\r\nmodestly presuming that her mother meant to part with her when her year\r\nwas up.', '“What have you got there, my love?” said Fanny; “come and shew it to\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nIt was a silver knife.', 'Up jumped Susan, claiming it as her own, and\r\ntrying to get it away; but the child ran to her mother’s protection,\r\nand Susan could only reproach, which she did very warmly, and evidently\r\nhoping to interest Fanny on her side.', 'she\r\nwas so fond of it, Fanny, that she would have it lay by her in bed, all\r\nthrough her illness.', 'He stepped\r\nback again to the door to say, “Take care of Fanny, mother.', 'I charge you,\r\ntake care of Fanny.”\r\n\r\nWilliam was gone: and the home he had left her in was, Fanny could not\r\nconceal it from herself, in almost every respect the very reverse of\r\nwhat she could have wished.', 'Her\r\nheart and her time were already quite full; she had neither leisure nor\r\naffection to bestow on Fanny.', 'Much of all this Fanny could not but be sensible of.', 'Her continual disagreements with her mother, her rash\r\nsquabbles with Tom and Charles, and petulance with Betsey, were at\r\nleast so distressing to Fanny that, though admitting they were by no\r\nmeans without provocation, she feared the disposition that could push\r\nthem to such length must be far from amiable, and from affording any\r\nrepose to herself.', 'The living in incessant noise was, to a frame and temper delicate and\r\nnervous like Fanny’s, an evil which no superadded elegance or harmony\r\ncould have entirely atoned for.', 'In a review of the two houses, as they appeared to her before the end\r\nof a week, Fanny was tempted to apply to them Dr. Johnson’s celebrated\r\njudgment as to matrimony and celibacy, and say, that though Mansfield\r\nPark might have some pains, Portsmouth could have no pleasures.', 'But there he is, and, by the bye, his\r\nabsence may sufficiently account for any remissness of his sister’s in\r\nwriting, for there has been no ‘Well, Mary, when do you write to Fanny?', 'Is not it time for you to write to Fanny?’ to spur me on.', 'my dear sweet Fanny, this is a long letter from London: write me\r\na pretty one in reply to gladden Henry’s eyes, when he comes back, and\r\nsend me an account of all the dashing young captains whom you disdain\r\nfor his sake.”\r\n\r\nThere was great food for meditation in this letter, and chiefly for\r\nunpleasant meditation; and yet, with all the uneasiness it supplied, it\r\nconnected her with the absent, it told her of people and things about\r\nwhom she had never felt so much curiosity as now, and she would have\r\nbeen glad to have been sure of such a letter every week.', 'The first solid consolation which Fanny received for the evils of home,\r\nthe first which her judgment could entirely approve, and which gave any\r\npromise of durability, was in a better knowledge of Susan, and a hope\r\nof being of service to her.', 'That\r\na girl of fourteen, acting only on her own unassisted reason, should\r\nerr in the method of reform, was not wonderful; and Fanny soon became\r\nmore disposed to admire the natural light of the mind which could so\r\nearly distinguish justly, than to censure severely the faults of\r\nconduct to which it led.', 'That her\r\nmanner was wrong, however, at times very wrong, her measures often\r\nill-chosen and ill-timed, and her looks and language very often\r\nindefensible, Fanny could not cease to feel; but she began to hope they\r\nmight be rectified.', 'Susan, she found, looked up to her and wished for\r\nher good opinion; and new as anything like an office of authority was\r\nto Fanny, new as it was to imagine herself capable of guiding or\r\ninforming any one, she did resolve to give occasional hints to Susan,\r\nand endeavour to exercise for her advantage the juster notions of what\r\nwas due to everybody, and what would be wisest for herself, which her\r\nown more favoured education had fixed in her.', 'She acknowledged her fears, blamed herself for\r\nhaving contended so warmly; and from that hour Fanny, understanding the\r\nworth of her disposition and perceiving how fully she was inclined to\r\nseek her good opinion and refer to her judgment, began to feel again\r\nthe blessing of affection, and to entertain the hope of being useful to\r\na mind so much in need of help, and so much deserving it.', 'By sitting together upstairs, they avoided a great deal of the\r\ndisturbance of the house; Fanny had peace, and Susan learned to think\r\nit no misfortune to be quietly employed.', 'They sat without a fire; but\r\nthat was a privation familiar even to Fanny, and she suffered the less\r\nbecause reminded by it of the East room.', 'By\r\ndegrees the girls came to spend the chief of the morning upstairs, at\r\nfirst only in working and talking, but after a few days, the\r\nremembrance of the said books grew so potent and stimulative that Fanny\r\nfound it impossible not to try for books again.', 'Susan had read\r\nnothing, and Fanny longed to give her a share in her own first\r\npleasures, and inspire a taste for the biography and poetry which she\r\ndelighted in herself.', 'CHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\n\r\nA week was gone since Edmund might be supposed in town, and Fanny had\r\nheard nothing of him.', 'One morning, about this time, Fanny having now been nearly four weeks\r\nfrom Mansfield, a point which she never failed to think over and\r\ncalculate every day, as she and Susan were preparing to remove, as\r\nusual, upstairs, they were stopped by the knock of a visitor, whom they\r\nfelt they could not avoid, from Rebecca’s alertness in going to the\r\ndoor, a duty which always interested her beyond any other.', 'It was a gentleman’s voice; it was a voice that Fanny was just turning\r\npale about, when Mr. Crawford walked into the room.', 'By the time he had given all this information, it was not unreasonable\r\nto suppose that Fanny might be looked at and spoken to; and she was\r\ntolerably able to bear his eye, and hear that he had spent half an hour\r\nwith his sister the evening before his leaving London; that she had\r\nsent her best and kindest love, but had had no time for writing; that\r\nhe thought himself lucky in seeing Mary for even half an hour, having\r\nspent scarcely twenty-four hours in London, after his return from\r\nNorfolk, before he set off again; that her cousin Edmund was in town,\r\nhad been in town, he understood, a few days; that he had not seen him\r\nhimself, but that he was well, had left them all well at Mansfield, and\r\nwas to dine, as yesterday, with the Frasers.', '“Her daughters were very much confined; Portsmouth was a sad place;\r\nthey did not often get out; and she knew they had some errands in the\r\ntown, which they would be very glad to do.” And the consequence was,\r\nthat Fanny, strange as it was—strange, awkward, and distressing—found\r\nherself and Susan, within ten minutes, walking towards the High Street\r\nwith Mr. Crawford.', 'He stopt; and,\r\nungentlemanlike as he looked, Fanny was obliged to introduce him to Mr.\r\nCrawford.', 'Mr. Crawford probably could not regard his future father-in-law with\r\nany idea of taking him for a model in dress; but (as Fanny instantly,\r\nand to her great relief, discerned) her father was a very different\r\nman, a very different Mr. Price in his behaviour to this most highly\r\nrespected stranger, from what he was in his own family at home.', 'Such was his\r\ninstinctive compliment to the good manners of Mr. Crawford; and, be the\r\nconsequence what it might, Fanny’s immediate feelings were infinitely\r\nsoothed.', 'The conclusion of the two gentlemen’s civilities was an offer of Mr.\r\nPrice’s to take Mr. Crawford into the dockyard, which Mr. Crawford,\r\ndesirous of accepting as a favour what was intended as such, though he\r\nhad seen the dockyard again and again, and hoping to be so much the\r\nlonger with Fanny, was very gratefully disposed to avail himself of, if\r\nthe Miss Prices were not afraid of the fatigue; and as it was somehow\r\nor other ascertained, or inferred, or at least acted upon, that they\r\nwere not at all afraid, to the dockyard they were all to go; and but\r\nfor Mr. Crawford, Mr. Price would have turned thither directly, without\r\nthe smallest consideration for his daughters’ errands in the High\r\nStreet.', 'He took care, however, that they should be allowed to go to the\r\nshops they came out expressly to visit; and it did not delay them long,\r\nfor Fanny could so little bear to excite impatience, or be waited for,\r\nthat before the gentlemen, as they stood at the door, could do more\r\nthan begin upon the last naval regulations, or settle the number of\r\nthree-deckers now in commission, their companions were ready to\r\nproceed.', 'Once fairly in the dockyard, he began to reckon upon some happy\r\nintercourse with Fanny, as they were very soon joined by a brother\r\nlounger of Mr. Price’s, who was come to take his daily survey of how\r\nthings went on, and who must prove a far more worthy companion than\r\nhimself; and after a time the two officers seemed very well satisfied\r\ngoing about together, and discussing matters of equal and never-failing\r\ninterest, while the young people sat down upon some timbers in the\r\nyard, or found a seat on board a vessel in the stocks which they all\r\nwent to look at.', 'He must content himself with being only generally\r\nagreeable, and letting Susan have her share of entertainment, with the\r\nindulgence, now and then, of a look or hint for the better-informed and\r\nconscious Fanny.', 'For Fanny, somewhat more was related than the accidental agreeableness\r\nof the parties he had been in.', 'This was\r\naimed, and well aimed, at Fanny.', 'When Mr. Price and his friend had seen all that they wished, or had\r\ntime for, the others were ready to return; and in the course of their\r\nwalk back, Mr. Crawford contrived a minute’s privacy for telling Fanny\r\nthat his only business in Portsmouth was to see her; that he was come\r\ndown for a couple of days on her account, and hers only, and because he\r\ncould not endure a longer total separation.', 'Her father asked him to do them the honour of\r\ntaking his mutton with them, and Fanny had time for only one thrill of\r\nhorror, before he declared himself prevented by a prior engagement.', 'Rebecca’s cookery and Rebecca’s\r\nwaiting, and Betsey’s eating at table without restraint, and pulling\r\neverything about as she chose, were what Fanny herself was not yet\r\nenough inured to for her often to make a tolerable meal.', 'Thither they now went; Mr. Crawford most happy to consider the Miss\r\nPrices as his peculiar charge; and before they had been there long,\r\nsomehow or other, there was no saying how, Fanny could not have\r\nbelieved it, but he was walking between them with an arm of each under\r\nhis, and she did not know how to prevent or put an end to it.', 'It was really March; but it was April in\r\nits mild air, brisk soft wind, and bright sun, occasionally clouded for\r\na minute; and everything looked so beautiful under the influence of\r\nsuch a sky, the effects of the shadows pursuing each other on the ships\r\nat Spithead and the island beyond, with the ever-varying hues of the\r\nsea, now at high water, dancing in its glee and dashing against the\r\nramparts with so fine a sound, produced altogether such a combination\r\nof charms for Fanny, as made her gradually almost careless of the\r\ncircumstances under which she felt them.', 'They\r\noften stopt with the same sentiment and taste, leaning against the\r\nwall, some minutes, to look and admire; and considering he was not\r\nEdmund, Fanny could not but allow that he was sufficiently open to the\r\ncharms of nature, and very well able to express his admiration.', 'If, therefore” (turning again to Fanny), “you find\r\nyourself growing unwell, and any difficulties arise about your\r\nreturning to Mansfield, without waiting for the two months to be ended,\r\n_that_ must not be regarded as of any consequence, if you feel yourself\r\nat all less strong or comfortable than usual, and will only let my\r\nsister know it, give her only the slightest hint, she and I will\r\nimmediately come down, and take you back to Mansfield.', '“I wish you were not so tired,” said he, still detaining Fanny after\r\nall the others were in the house—“I wish I left you in stronger health.', 'Good-bye; I wish you\r\na pleasant journey to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“Is there nothing I can do for you in town?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing; I am much obliged to you.”\r\n\r\n“Have you no message for anybody?”\r\n\r\n“My love to your sister, if you please; and when you see my cousin, my\r\ncousin Edmund, I wish you would be so good as to say that I suppose I\r\nshall soon hear from him.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; and if he is lazy or negligent, I will write his excuses\r\nmyself.”\r\n\r\nHe could say no more, for Fanny would be no longer detained.', 'CHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was presumed that Mr. Crawford was travelling back, to London, on\r\nthe morrow, for nothing more was seen of him at Mr. Price’s; and two\r\ndays afterwards, it was a fact ascertained to Fanny by the following\r\nletter from his sister, opened and read by her, on another account,\r\nwith the most anxious curiosity:—\r\n\r\n“I have to inform you, my dearest Fanny, that Henry has been down to\r\nPortsmouth to see you; that he had a delightful walk with you to the\r\ndockyard last Saturday, and one still more to be dwelt on the next day,\r\non the ramparts; when the balmy air, the sparkling sea, and your sweet\r\nlooks and conversation were altogether in the most delicious harmony,\r\nand afforded sensations which are to raise ecstasy even in retrospect.', 'My dear, dear Fanny, if I had you here, how I would talk to you!', 'This was Fanny’s most frequent expectation.', 'Susan was growing very fond of her, and though without any of the early\r\ndelight in books which had been so strong in Fanny, with a disposition\r\nmuch less inclined to sedentary pursuits, or to information for\r\ninformation’s sake, she had so strong a desire of not _appearing_\r\nignorant, as, with a good clear understanding, made her a most\r\nattentive, profitable, thankful pupil.', 'What Fanny told her of former times dwelt\r\nmore on her mind than the pages of Goldsmith; and she paid her sister\r\nthe compliment of preferring her style to that of any printed author.', 'Susan, who had an innate taste for the genteel and\r\nwell-appointed, was eager to hear, and Fanny could not but indulge\r\nherself in dwelling on so beloved a theme.', 'Poor Susan was very little better fitted for home than her elder\r\nsister; and as Fanny grew thoroughly to understand this, she began to\r\nfeel that when her own release from Portsmouth came, her happiness\r\nwould have a material drawback in leaving Susan behind.', 'CHAPTER XLIV\r\n\r\n\r\nSeven weeks of the two months were very nearly gone, when the one\r\nletter, the letter from Edmund, so long expected, was put into Fanny’s\r\nhands.', 'These were the\r\ncontents—\r\n\r\n“My Dear Fanny,—Excuse me that I have not written before.', 'I cannot give her up, Fanny.', 'You have my thoughts exactly\r\nas they arise, my dear Fanny; perhaps they are sometimes contradictory,\r\nbut it will not be a less faithful picture of my mind.', 'This\r\nlong letter, full of my own concerns alone, will be enough to tire even\r\nthe friendship of a Fanny.', 'I am not\r\ncomfortable enough to be fit for anybody; but your aunt seems to feel\r\nout of luck that such an article of Mansfield news should fall to my\r\npen instead of hers.—Yours ever, my dearest Fanny.”\r\n\r\n“I never will, no, I certainly never will wish for a letter again,” was\r\nFanny’s secret declaration as she finished this.', '‘The loss of Mary I must\r\nconsider as comprehending the loss of Crawford and Fanny.’ Edmund, you\r\ndo not know me.', 'Fix, commit, condemn yourself.”\r\n\r\nSuch sensations, however, were too near akin to resentment to be long\r\nguiding Fanny’s soliloquies.', 'Within a few days from the receipt of Edmund’s\r\nletter, Fanny had one from her aunt, beginning thus—\r\n\r\n“My Dear Fanny,—I take up my pen to communicate some very alarming\r\nintelligence, which I make no doubt will give you much concern”.', 'As I have\r\nlittle doubt of your feeling for us, my dear Fanny, under these\r\ndistressing circumstances, I will write again very soon.”\r\n\r\nFanny’s feelings on the occasion were indeed considerably more warm and\r\ngenuine than her aunt’s style of writing.', 'Her aunt did not neglect her: she wrote\r\nagain and again; they were receiving frequent accounts from Edmund, and\r\nthese accounts were as regularly transmitted to Fanny, in the same\r\ndiffuse style, and the same medley of trusts, hopes, and fears, all\r\nfollowing and producing each other at haphazard.', '“He is just\r\ncome, my dear Fanny, and is taken upstairs; and I am so shocked to see\r\nhim, that I do not know what to do.', 'Three\r\nor four Prices might have been swept away, any or all except Fanny and\r\nWilliam, and Lady Bertram would have thought little about it; or\r\nperhaps might have caught from Mrs. Norris’s lips the cant of its being\r\na very happy thing and a great blessing to their poor dear sister Price\r\nto have them so well provided for.', 'Lady Bertram\r\ncould think nothing less, and Fanny shared her aunt’s security, till\r\nshe received a few lines from Edmund, written purposely to give her a\r\nclearer idea of his brother’s situation, and acquaint her with the\r\napprehensions which he and his father had imbibed from the physician\r\nwith respect to some strong hectic symptoms, which seemed to seize the\r\nframe on the departure of the fever.', 'They judged it best that Lady\r\nBertram should not be harassed by alarms which, it was to be hoped,\r\nwould prove unfounded; but there was no reason why Fanny should not\r\nknow the truth.', 'A line occasionally added by Edmund to his\r\nmother’s letter was enough for Fanny’s information.', 'Easter came particularly late this year, as Fanny had most sorrowfully\r\nconsidered, on first learning that she had no chance of leaving\r\nPortsmouth till after it.', 'It was sad to Fanny to lose all the pleasures of spring.', 'It was so long since Fanny had had any letter from her,\r\nthat she had some reason to think lightly of the friendship which had\r\nbeen so dwelt on.', 'It was weeks since she had heard anything of Miss\r\nCrawford or of her other connexions in town, except through Mansfield,\r\nand she was beginning to suppose that she might never know whether Mr.\r\nCrawford had gone into Norfolk again or not till they met, and might\r\nnever hear from his sister any more this spring, when the following\r\nletter was received to revive old and create some new sensations—\r\n\r\n“Forgive me, my dear Fanny, as soon as you can, for my long silence,\r\nand behave as if you could forgive me directly.', 'Fanny, Fanny,\r\nI see you smile and look cunning, but, upon my honour, I never bribed a\r\nphysician in my life.', 'With real affection, Fanny, like\r\nmine, more might be overlooked.', 'Dear Fanny, write directly, and tell us to come.', 'CHAPTER XLVI\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Fanny could not doubt that her answer was conveying a real\r\ndisappointment, she was rather in expectation, from her knowledge of\r\nMiss Crawford’s temper, of being urged again; and though no second\r\nletter arrived for the space of a week, she had still the same feeling\r\nwhen it did come.', 'This was the letter—\r\n\r\n“A most scandalous, ill-natured rumour has just reached me, and I\r\nwrite, dear Fanny, to warn you against giving the least credit to it,\r\nshould it spread into the country.', 'A little flogging for man and woman too\r\nwould be the best way of preventing such things.”\r\n\r\nFanny read to herself that “it was with infinite concern the newspaper\r\nhad to announce to the world a matrimonial _fracas_ in the family of\r\nMr. R. of Wimpole Street; the beautiful Mrs. R., whose name had not\r\nlong been enrolled in the lists of Hymen, and who had promised to\r\nbecome so brilliant a leader in the fashionable world, having quitted\r\nher husband’s roof in company with the well-known and captivating Mr.\r\nC., the intimate friend and associate of Mr. R., and it was not known\r\neven to the editor of the newspaper whither they were gone.”\r\n\r\n“It is a mistake, sir,” said Fanny instantly; “it must be a mistake, it\r\ncannot be true; it must mean some other people.”\r\n\r\nShe spoke from the instinctive wish of delaying shame; she spoke with a\r\nresolution which sprung from despair, for she spoke what she did not,\r\ncould not believe herself.', 'And it would not be ten minutes’ work.”\r\n\r\nThe horror of a mind like Fanny’s, as it received the conviction of\r\nsuch guilt, and began to take in some part of the misery that must\r\nensue, can hardly be described.', '“Dear Fanny,—You know our present wretchedness.', 'You will see me early by the\r\nmail.—Yours, etc.”\r\n\r\nNever had Fanny more wanted a cordial.', 'The girls heard his\r\nentrance from above, and Fanny went down.', 'He was alone, and met her\r\ninstantly; and she found herself pressed to his heart with only these\r\nwords, just articulate, “My Fanny, my only sister; my only comfort\r\nnow!” She could say nothing; nor for some minutes could he say more.', 'He was gone again; glad\r\nto get away even from Fanny.', 'Edmund’s deep sighs often\r\nreached Fanny.', 'Just before their setting out from Oxford, while Susan was\r\nstationed at a window, in eager observation of the departure of a large\r\nfamily from the inn, the other two were standing by the fire; and\r\nEdmund, particularly struck by the alteration in Fanny’s looks, and\r\nfrom his ignorance of the daily evils of her father’s house,\r\nattributing an undue share of the change, attributing _all_ to the\r\nrecent event, took her hand, and said in a low, but very expressive\r\ntone, “No wonder—you must feel it—you must suffer.', 'Fanny had scarcely passed the\r\nsolemn-looking servants, when Lady Bertram came from the drawing-room\r\nto meet her; came with no indolent step; and falling on her neck, said,\r\n“Dear Fanny!', 'Edmund was almost as welcome\r\nto his brother as Fanny to her aunt; but Mrs. Norris, instead of having\r\ncomfort from either, was but the more irritated by the sight of the\r\nperson whom, in the blindness of her anger, she could have charged as\r\nthe daemon of the piece.', 'Had Fanny accepted Mr. Crawford this could not\r\nhave happened.', 'Lady Bertram could not give her\r\nmuch time, or many words, but she felt her, as Fanny’s sister, to have\r\na claim at Mansfield, and was ready to kiss and like her; and Susan was\r\nmore than satisfied, for she came perfectly aware that nothing but\r\nill-humour was to be expected from aunt Norris; and was so provided\r\nwith happiness, so strong in that best of blessings, an escape from\r\nmany certain evils, that she could have stood against a great deal more\r\nindifference than she met with from the others.', 'She was now left a good deal to herself, to get acquainted with the\r\nhouse and grounds as she could, and spent her days very happily in so\r\ndoing, while those who might otherwise have attended to her were shut\r\nup, or wholly occupied each with the person quite dependent on them, at\r\nthis time, for everything like comfort; Edmund trying to bury his own\r\nfeelings in exertions for the relief of his brother’s, and Fanny\r\ndevoted to her aunt Bertram, returning to every former office with more\r\nthan former zeal, and thinking she could never do enough for one who\r\nseemed so much to want her.', 'To talk over the dreadful business with Fanny, talk and lament, was all\r\nLady Bertram’s consolation.', 'Lady Bertram did not think deeply, but,\r\nguided by Sir Thomas, she thought justly on all important points; and\r\nshe saw, therefore, in all its enormity, what had happened, and neither\r\nendeavoured herself, nor required Fanny to advise her, to think little\r\nof guilt and infamy.', 'After a\r\ntime, Fanny found it not impossible to direct her thoughts to other\r\nsubjects, and revive some interest in the usual occupations; but\r\nwhenever Lady Bertram _was_ fixed on the event, she could see it only\r\nin one light, as comprehending the loss of a daughter, and a disgrace\r\nnever to be wiped off.', 'His\r\nhaving been in the same neighbourhood Fanny already knew.', '_His_ present state Fanny could hardly bear to think of.', 'He was aware of what Edmund must be suffering on his own behalf, in\r\naddition to all the rest, when they were in town: he had seen or\r\nconjectured his feelings; and, having reason to think that one\r\ninterview with Miss Crawford had taken place, from which Edmund derived\r\nonly increased distress, had been as anxious on that account as on\r\nothers to get him out of town, and had engaged him in taking Fanny home\r\nto her aunt, with a view to his relief and benefit, no less than\r\ntheirs.', 'That Edmund must be for ever divided from Miss Crawford did not admit\r\nof a doubt with Fanny; and yet, till she knew that he felt the same,\r\nher own conviction was insufficient.', 'How Fanny listened, with what curiosity and concern, what pain and what\r\ndelight, how the agitation of his voice was watched, and how carefully\r\nher own eyes were fixed on any object but himself, may be imagined.', 'He had received a note from Lady Stornaway to beg him to call;\r\nand regarding it as what was meant to be the last, last interview of\r\nfriendship, and investing her with all the feelings of shame and\r\nwretchedness which Crawford’s sister ought to have known, he had gone\r\nto her in such a state of mind, so softened, so devoted, as made it for\r\na few moments impossible to Fanny’s fears that it should be the last.', 'With a graver look and voice she then\r\nadded, ‘I do not mean to defend Henry at your sister’s expense.’ So she\r\nbegan, but how she went on, Fanny, is not fit, is hardly fit to be\r\nrepeated to you.', 'For where, Fanny, shall we find\r\na woman whom nature had so richly endowed?', 'The want\r\nof common discretion, of caution: his going down to Richmond for the\r\nwhole time of her being at Twickenham; her putting herself in the power\r\nof a servant; it was the detection, in short—oh, Fanny!', '“And what,” said Fanny (believing herself required to speak),\r\n“what could you say?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, nothing to be understood.', 'My eyes are opened.”\r\n\r\n“Cruel!” said Fanny, “quite cruel.', 'Hers are faults of\r\nprinciple, Fanny; of blunted delicacy and a corrupted, vitiated mind.', 'She spoke of\r\nit, Fanny, with a steadier voice than I can.” He was obliged to pause\r\nmore than once as he continued.', '“‘We must persuade Henry to marry her,’\r\nsaid she; ‘and what with honour, and the certainty of having shut\r\nhimself out for ever from Fanny, I do not despair of it.', 'Let Sir Thomas\r\ntrust to his honour and compassion, and it may all end well; but if he\r\nget his daughter away, it will be destroying the chief hold.’”\r\n\r\nAfter repeating this, Edmund was so much affected that Fanny, watching\r\nhim with silent, but most tender concern, was almost sorry that the\r\nsubject had been entered on at all.', 'At last, “Now, Fanny,” said he, “I shall soon have done.', 'I had gone a few steps, Fanny, when I heard\r\nthe door open behind me.', 'I thank you for your patience, Fanny.', 'This\r\nhas been the greatest relief, and now we will have done.”\r\n\r\nAnd such was Fanny’s dependence on his words, that for five minutes she\r\nthought they _had_ done.', 'My Fanny, indeed, at this very time, I have the satisfaction of\r\nknowing, must have been happy in spite of everything.', 'After wandering about and\r\nsitting under trees with Fanny all the summer evenings, he had so well\r\ntalked his mind into submission as to be very tolerably cheerful again.', 'She had lived with him to be reproached as the ruin of all his\r\nhappiness in Fanny, and carried away no better consolation in leaving\r\nhim than that she _had_ divided them.', 'Sir Thomas would not hear of it; and Mrs.\r\nNorris’s anger against Fanny was so much the greater, from considering\r\n_her_ residence there as the motive.', 'Not even Fanny had tears for aunt Norris, not\r\neven when she was gone for ever.', 'Could he have been satisfied with the conquest of one\r\namiable woman’s affections, could he have found sufficient exultation\r\nin overcoming the reluctance, in working himself into the esteem and\r\ntenderness of Fanny Price, there would have been every probability of\r\nsuccess and felicity for him.', 'Would he have\r\npersevered, and uprightly, Fanny must have been his reward, and a\r\nreward very voluntarily bestowed, within a reasonable period from\r\nEdmund’s marrying Mary.', 'He saw Mrs. Rushworth,\r\nwas received by her with a coldness which ought to have been repulsive,\r\nand have established apparent indifference between them for ever; but\r\nhe was mortified, he could not bear to be thrown off by the woman whose\r\nsmiles had been so wholly at his command: he must exert himself to\r\nsubdue so proud a display of resentment; it was anger on Fanny’s\r\naccount; he must get the better of it, and make Mrs. Rushworth Maria\r\nBertram again in her treatment of himself.', 'To keep Fanny and the Bertrams\r\nfrom a knowledge of what was passing became his first object.', 'All that followed was the result of\r\nher imprudence; and he went off with her at last, because he could not\r\nhelp it, regretting Fanny even at the moment, but regretting her\r\ninfinitely more when all the bustle of the intrigue was over, and a\r\nvery few months had taught him, by the force of contrast, to place a\r\nyet higher value on the sweetness of her temper, the purity of her\r\nmind, and the excellence of her principles.', 'Scarcely had he done regretting Mary Crawford, and\r\nobserving to Fanny how impossible it was that he should ever meet with\r\nsuch another woman, before it began to strike him whether a very\r\ndifferent kind of woman might not do just as well, or a great deal\r\nbetter: whether Fanny herself were not growing as dear, as important to\r\nhim in all her smiles and all her ways, as Mary Crawford had ever been;\r\nand whether it might not be a possible, a hopeful undertaking to\r\npersuade her that her warm and sisterly regard for him would be\r\nfoundation enough for wedded love.', 'I only entreat everybody to believe that\r\nexactly at the time when it was quite natural that it should be so, and\r\nnot a week earlier, Edmund did cease to care about Miss Crawford, and\r\nbecame as anxious to marry Fanny as Fanny herself could desire.', 'Even in the midst of his late\r\ninfatuation, he had acknowledged Fanny’s mental superiority.', 'Sick of ambitious and mercenary\r\nconnexions, prizing more and more the sterling good of principle and\r\ntemper, and chiefly anxious to bind by the strongest securities all\r\nthat remained to him of domestic felicity, he had pondered with genuine\r\nsatisfaction on the more than possibility of the two young friends\r\nfinding their natural consolation in each other for all that had\r\noccurred of disappointment to either; and the joyful consent which met\r\nEdmund’s application, the high sense of having realised a great\r\nacquisition in the promise of Fanny for a daughter, formed just such a\r\ncontrast with his early opinion on the subject when the poor little\r\ngirl’s coming had been first agitated, as time is for ever producing\r\nbetween the plans and decisions of mortals, for their own instruction,\r\nand their neighbours’ entertainment.', 'Susan became the stationary niece,\r\ndelighted to be so; and equally well adapted for it by a readiness of\r\nmind, and an inclination for usefulness, as Fanny had been by sweetness\r\nof temper, and strong feelings of gratitude.', 'First as a comfort to Fanny, then as an auxiliary, and last as\r\nher substitute, she was established at Mansfield, with every appearance\r\nof equal permanency.', 'With quickness in understanding the\r\ntempers of those she had to deal with, and no natural timidity to\r\nrestrain any consequent wishes, she was soon welcome and useful to all;\r\nand after Fanny’s removal succeeded so naturally to her influence over\r\nthe hourly comfort of her aunt, as gradually to become, perhaps, the\r\nmost beloved of the two.', 'In _her_ usefulness, in Fanny’s excellence, in\r\nWilliam’s continued good conduct and rising fame, and in the general\r\nwell-doing and success of the other members of the family, all\r\nassisting to advance each other, and doing credit to his countenance\r\nand aid, Sir Thomas saw repeated, and for ever repeated, reason to\r\nrejoice in what he had done for them all, and acknowledge the\r\nadvantages of early hardship and discipline, and the consciousness of\r\nbeing born to struggle and endure.', 'On that event they removed to Mansfield; and the Parsonage there,\r\nwhich, under each of its two former owners, Fanny had never been able\r\nto approach but with some painful sensation of restraint or alarm, soon\r\ngrew as dear to her heart, and as thoroughly perfect in her eyes, as\r\neverything else within the view and patronage of Mansfield Park had\r\nlong been.']

but though this circumstance had made the arrangement\r\nsomewhat easier to Sir Thomas’s conscience, he could not but feel it to\r\nbe an act of injustice, and he earnestly tried to impress his eldest\r\nson with the same conviction, in the hope of its producing a better\r\neffect than anything he had yet been able to say or do.', 'You have robbed Edmund for ten,\r\ntwenty, thirty years, perhaps for life, of more than half the income\r\nwhich ought to be his.', 'As soon as she met with Edmund she\r\ntold him her distress.', 'Fanny soon learnt how unnecessary had been her fears of a removal; and\r\nher spontaneous, untaught felicity on the discovery, conveyed some\r\nconsolation to Edmund for his disappointment in what he had expected to\r\nbe so essentially serviceable to her.', 'He could not\r\nthink Lady Bertram quite equal to supply his place with them, or\r\nrather, to perform what should have been her own; but, in Mrs. Norris’s\r\nwatchful attention, and in Edmund’s judgment, he had sufficient\r\nconfidence to make him go without fears for their conduct.', 'CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nTom Bertram had of late spent so little of his time at home that he\r\ncould be only nominally missed; and Lady Bertram was soon astonished to\r\nfind how very well they did even without his father, how well Edmund\r\ncould supply his place in carving, talking to the steward, writing to\r\nthe attorney, settling with the servants, and equally saving her from\r\nall possible fatigue or exertion in every particular but that of\r\ndirecting her letters.', 'The earliest intelligence of the travellers’ safe arrival at Antigua,\r\nafter a favourable voyage, was received; though not before Mrs. Norris\r\nhad been indulging in very dreadful fears, and trying to make Edmund\r\nparticipate them whenever she could get him alone; and as she depended\r\non being the first person made acquainted with any fatal catastrophe,\r\nshe had already arranged the manner of breaking it to all the others,\r\nwhen Sir Thomas’s assurances of their both being alive and well made it\r\nnecessary to lay by her agitation and affectionate preparatory speeches\r\nfor a while.', 'As to her cousins’ gaieties, she loved to hear an account of them,\r\nespecially of the balls, and whom Edmund had danced with; but thought\r\ntoo lowly of her own situation to imagine she should ever be admitted\r\nto the same, and listened, therefore, without an idea of any nearer\r\nconcern in them.', 'Though Edmund was much more displeased with his aunt than with his\r\nmother, as evincing least regard for her niece, he could not help\r\npaying more attention to what she said; and at length determined on a\r\nmethod of proceeding which would obviate the risk of his father’s\r\nthinking he had done too much, and at the same time procure for Fanny\r\nthe immediate means of exercise, which he could not bear she should be\r\nwithout.', 'She had not supposed before that anything could ever suit her like the\r\nold grey pony; but her delight in Edmund’s mare was far beyond any\r\nformer pleasure of the sort; and the addition it was ever receiving in\r\nthe consideration of that kindness from which her pleasure sprung, was\r\nbeyond all her words to express.', '_He_ had been much in London, and had more liveliness and\r\ngallantry than Edmund, and must, therefore, be preferred; and, indeed,\r\nhis being the eldest was another strong claim.', 'I do not pretend to set\r\npeople right, but I do see that they are often wrong.”\r\n\r\n“Those who are showing the world what female manners _should_ be,” said\r\nMr. Bertram gallantly, “are doing a great deal to set them right.”\r\n\r\n“The error is plain enough,” said the less courteous Edmund; “such\r\ngirls are ill brought up.', 'My friend\r\nSneyd—you have heard me speak of Sneyd, Edmund—his father, and mother,\r\nand sisters, were there, all new to me.', 'Does she dine out every where, as well as at my sister’s?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Edmund; “I do not think she has ever been to a ball.', 'In comparison with his brother, Edmund\r\nwould have nothing to say.', 'One likes to get out into a shrubbery in fine\r\nweather.”\r\n\r\nMr. Rushworth was eager to assure her ladyship of his acquiescence, and\r\ntried to make out something complimentary; but, between his submission\r\nto _her_ taste, and his having always intended the same himself, with\r\nthe superadded objects of professing attention to the comfort of ladies\r\nin general, and of insinuating that there was one only whom he was\r\nanxious to please, he grew puzzled, and Edmund was glad to put an end\r\nto his speech by a proposal of wine.', 'I really know very little of\r\nSotherton.”\r\n\r\nFanny, who was sitting on the other side of Edmund, exactly opposite\r\nMiss Crawford, and who had been attentively listening, now looked at\r\nhim, and said in a low voice—\r\n\r\n“Cut down an avenue!', 'I am\r\nassured that it is safe at Northampton; and there it has probably been\r\nthese ten days, in spite of the solemn assurances we have so often\r\nreceived to the contrary.” Edmund expressed his pleasure and surprise.', 'Yours sincerely.’ That is the true manly style;\r\nthat is a complete brother’s letter.”\r\n\r\n“When they are at a distance from all their family,” said Fanny,\r\ncolouring for William’s sake, “they can write long letters.”\r\n\r\n“Miss Price has a brother at sea,” said Edmund, “whose excellence as a\r\ncorrespondent makes her think you too severe upon us.”\r\n\r\n“At sea, has she?', 'In the king’s service, of course?”\r\n\r\nFanny would rather have had Edmund tell the story, but his determined\r\nsilence obliged her to relate her brother’s situation: her voice was\r\nanimated in speaking of his profession, and the foreign stations he had\r\nbeen on; but she could not mention the number of years that he had been\r\nabsent without tears in her eyes.', '“Do you know anything of my cousin’s captain?” said Edmund; “Captain\r\nMarshall?', 'I dare say Mr. Crawford would take my two nieces and me\r\nin his barouche, and Edmund can go on horseback, you know, sister, and\r\nFanny will stay at home with you.”\r\n\r\nLady Bertram made no objection; and every one concerned in the going\r\nwas forward in expressing their ready concurrence, excepting Edmund,\r\nwho heard it all and said nothing.', 'CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\n“Well, Fanny, and how do you like Miss Crawford _now_?” said Edmund the\r\nnext day, after thinking some time on the subject himself.', 'Without studying the business, however, or knowing what he\r\nwas about, Edmund was beginning, at the end of a week of such\r\nintercourse, to be a good deal in love; and to the credit of the lady\r\nit may be added that, without his being a man of the world or an elder\r\nbrother, without any of the arts of flattery or the gaieties of small\r\ntalk, he began to be agreeable to her.', 'Fanny could not wonder that Edmund was at the Parsonage every morning;\r\nshe would gladly have been there too, might she have gone in uninvited\r\nand unnoticed, to hear the harp; neither could she wonder that, when\r\nthe evening stroll was over, and the two families parted again, he\r\nshould think it right to attend Mrs. Grant and her sister to their\r\nhome, while Mr. Crawford was devoted to the ladies of the Park; but she\r\nthought it a very bad exchange; and if Edmund were not there to mix the\r\nwine and water for her, would rather go without it than not.', 'The first actual pain which Miss Crawford occasioned her\r\nwas the consequence of an inclination to learn to ride, which the\r\nformer caught, soon after her being settled at Mansfield, from the\r\nexample of the young ladies at the Park, and which, when Edmund’s\r\nacquaintance with her increased, led to his encouraging the wish, and\r\nthe offer of his own quiet mare for the purpose of her first attempts,\r\nas the best fitted for a beginner that either stable could furnish.', 'Active and fearless,\r\nand though rather small, strongly made, she seemed formed for a\r\nhorsewoman; and to the pure genuine pleasure of the exercise, something\r\nwas probably added in Edmund’s attendance and instructions, and\r\nsomething more in the conviction of very much surpassing her sex in\r\ngeneral by her early progress, to make her unwilling to dismount.', 'Fanny\r\nwas ready and waiting, and Mrs. Norris was beginning to scold her for\r\nnot being gone, and still no horse was announced, no Edmund appeared.', 'It was a sound\r\nwhich did not make _her_ cheerful; she wondered that Edmund should\r\nforget her, and felt a pang.', 'She must not\r\nwonder at all this; what could be more natural than that Edmund should\r\nbe making himself useful, and proving his good-nature by any one?', 'Her feelings for one and the other were soon a little tranquillised by\r\nseeing the party in the meadow disperse, and Miss Crawford still on\r\nhorseback, but attended by Edmund on foot, pass through a gate into the\r\nlane, and so into the park, and make towards the spot where she stood.', 'Selfishness must always be forgiven,\r\nyou know, because there is no hope of a cure.”\r\n\r\nFanny’s answer was extremely civil, and Edmund added his conviction\r\nthat she could be in no hurry.', 'I cannot but think that good horsemanship has a\r\ngreat deal to do with the mind.”\r\n\r\nWhen they parted at night Edmund asked Fanny whether she meant to ride\r\nthe next day.', 'Between ten and eleven Edmund and Julia walked into the drawing-room,\r\nfresh with the evening air, glowing and cheerful, the very reverse of\r\nwhat they found in the three ladies sitting there, for Maria would\r\nscarcely raise her eyes from her book, and Lady Bertram was\r\nhalf-asleep; and even Mrs. Norris, discomposed by her niece’s\r\nill-humour, and having asked one or two questions about the dinner,\r\nwhich were not immediately attended to, seemed almost determined to say\r\nno more.', 'For a few minutes the brother and sister were too eager in\r\ntheir praise of the night and their remarks on the stars, to think\r\nbeyond themselves; but when the first pause came, Edmund, looking\r\naround, said, “But where is Fanny?', 'You should learn to think of other people; and, take my word for it, it\r\nis a shocking trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a\r\nsofa.”\r\n\r\nBefore half this was said, Fanny was returned to her seat at the table,\r\nand had taken up her work again; and Julia, who was in high\r\ngood-humour, from the pleasures of the day, did her the justice of\r\nexclaiming, “I must say, ma’am, that Fanny is as little upon the sofa\r\nas anybody in the house.”\r\n\r\n“Fanny,” said Edmund, after looking at her attentively, “I am sure you\r\nhave the headache.”\r\n\r\nShe could not deny it, but said it was not very bad.', 'Even your\r\nmother was out to-day for above an hour.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed, Edmund,” added her ladyship, who had been thoroughly\r\nawakened by Mrs. Norris’s sharp reprimand to Fanny; “I was out above an\r\nhour.', 'Suppose you let her have your aromatic vinegar; I always\r\nforget to have mine filled.”\r\n\r\n“She has got it,” said Lady Bertram; “she has had it ever since she\r\ncame back from your house the second time.”\r\n\r\n“What!” cried Edmund; “has she been walking as well as cutting roses;\r\nwalking across the hot park to your house, and doing it twice, ma’am?', 'Between ourselves, Edmund,” nodding significantly at his mother, “it\r\nwas cutting the roses, and dawdling about in the flower-garden, that\r\ndid the mischief.”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid it was, indeed,” said the more candid Lady Bertram, who\r\nhad overheard her; “I am very much afraid she caught the headache\r\nthere, for the heat was enough to kill anybody.', 'Vexed as Edmund was with his mother and aunt, he was still more angry\r\nwith himself.', 'As she\r\nleant on the sofa, to which she had retreated that she might not be\r\nseen, the pain of her mind had been much beyond that in her head; and\r\nthe sudden change which Edmund’s kindness had then occasioned, made her\r\nhardly know how to support herself.', 'She\r\nwill have a companion in Fanny Price, you know, so it will all do very\r\nwell; and as for Edmund, as he is not here to speak for himself, I will\r\nanswer for his being most happy to join the party.', 'Mr. Rushworth came back from the\r\nParsonage successful; and Edmund made his appearance just in time to\r\nlearn what had been settled for Wednesday, to attend Mrs. Rushworth to\r\nher carriage, and walk half-way down the park with the two other\r\nladies.', '“But why is it necessary,” said Edmund, “that Crawford’s carriage, or\r\nhis _only_, should be employed?', 'No, my dear Edmund, that\r\nwill not quite do.”\r\n\r\n“Besides,” said Maria, “I know that Mr. Crawford depends upon taking\r\nus.', 'After what passed at first, he would claim it as a promise.”\r\n\r\n“And, my dear Edmund,” added Mrs. Norris, “taking out _two_ carriages\r\nwhen _one_ will do, would be trouble for nothing; and, between\r\nourselves, coachman is not very fond of the roads between this and\r\nSotherton: he always complains bitterly of the narrow lanes scratching\r\nhis carriage, and you know one should not like to have dear Sir Thomas,\r\nwhen he comes home, find all the varnish scratched off.”\r\n\r\n“That would not be a very handsome reason for using Mr. Crawford’s,”\r\nsaid Maria; “but the truth is, that Wilcox is a stupid old fellow, and\r\ndoes not know how to drive.', 'I will answer for it that we shall find no\r\ninconvenience from narrow roads on Wednesday.”\r\n\r\n“There is no hardship, I suppose, nothing unpleasant,” said Edmund, “in\r\ngoing on the barouche box.”\r\n\r\n“Unpleasant!” cried Maria: “oh dear!', 'Probably Miss Crawford will choose the barouche-box\r\nherself.”\r\n\r\n“There can be no objection, then, to Fanny’s going with you; there can\r\nbe no doubt of your having room for her.”\r\n\r\n“Fanny!” repeated Mrs. Norris; “my dear Edmund, there is no idea of her\r\ngoing with us.', 'Mrs. Norris had no affection\r\nfor Fanny, and no wish of procuring her pleasure at any time; but her\r\nopposition to Edmund _now_, arose more from partiality for her own\r\nscheme, because it _was_ her own, than from anything else.', 'When Edmund, therefore, told her in\r\nreply, as he did when she would give him the hearing, that she need not\r\ndistress herself on Mrs. Rushworth’s account, because he had taken the\r\nopportunity, as he walked with her through the hall, of mentioning Miss\r\nPrice as one who would probably be of the party, and had directly\r\nreceived a very sufficient invitation for his cousin, Mrs. Norris was\r\ntoo much vexed to submit with a very good grace, and would only say,\r\n“Very well, very well, just as you chuse, settle it your own way, I am\r\nsure I do not care about it.”\r\n\r\n“It seems very odd,” said Maria, “that you should be staying at home\r\ninstead of Fanny.”\r\n\r\n“I am sure she ought to be very much obliged to you,” added Julia,\r\nhastily leaving the room as she spoke, from a consciousness that she\r\nought to offer to stay at home herself.', 'She felt Edmund’s kindness with all, and more than\r\nall, the sensibility which he, unsuspicious of her fond attachment,\r\ncould be aware of; but that he should forego any enjoyment on her\r\naccount gave her pain, and her own satisfaction in seeing Sotherton\r\nwould be nothing without him.', 'Even Edmund was very thankful for an\r\narrangement which restored him to his share of the party; and Mrs.\r\nNorris thought it an excellent plan, and had it at her tongue’s end,\r\nand was on the point of proposing it, when Mrs. Grant spoke.', 'Her own thoughts and reflections were habitually her\r\nbest companions; and, in observing the appearance of the country, the\r\nbearings of the roads, the difference of soil, the state of the\r\nharvest, the cottages, the cattle, the children, she found\r\nentertainment that could only have been heightened by having Edmund to\r\nspeak to of what she felt.', '“I am disappointed,” said she, in a low\r\nvoice, to Edmund.', 'Prayers were always read in it by the domestic chaplain, within the\r\nmemory of many; but the late Mr. Rushworth left it off.”\r\n\r\n“Every generation has its improvements,” said Miss Crawford, with a\r\nsmile, to Edmund.', '“It must do the heads\r\nof the family a great deal of good to force all the poor housemaids and\r\nfootmen to leave business and pleasure, and say their prayers here\r\ntwice a day, while they are inventing excuses themselves for staying\r\naway.”\r\n\r\n“_That_ is hardly Fanny’s idea of a family assembling,” said Edmund.', '“If Edmund were but in orders!” cried Julia, and running to where he\r\nstood with Miss Crawford and Fanny: “My dear Edmund, if you were but in\r\norders now, you might perform the ceremony directly.', 'And you know\r\nthere is generally an uncle or a grandfather to leave a fortune to the\r\nsecond son.”\r\n\r\n“A very praiseworthy practice,” said Edmund, “but not quite universal.', 'Fanny made the first\r\ninterruption by saying, “I wonder that I should be tired with only\r\nwalking in this sweet wood; but the next time we come to a seat, if it\r\nis not disagreeable to you, I should be glad to sit down for a little\r\nwhile.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Fanny,” cried Edmund, immediately drawing her arm within his,\r\n“how thoughtless I have been!', 'I know nothing of your furlongs, but I am sure it is a very long\r\nwood, and that we have been winding in and out ever since we came into\r\nit; and therefore, when I say that we have walked a mile in it, I must\r\nspeak within compass.”\r\n\r\n“We have been exactly a quarter of an hour here,” said Edmund, taking\r\nout his watch.', '“I am afraid you are very tired, Fanny,” said Edmund, observing her;\r\n“why would not you speak sooner?', 'CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour, twenty minutes, passed away, and Fanny was still\r\nthinking of Edmund, Miss Crawford, and herself, without interruption\r\nfrom any one.', 'The mother I could not avoid, as long as my tiresome aunt\r\nwas dancing about with the housekeeper, but the son I _can_ get away\r\nfrom.”\r\n\r\nAnd she immediately scrambled across the fence, and walked away, not\r\nattending to Fanny’s last question of whether she had seen anything of\r\nMiss Crawford and Edmund.', 'Fanny’s best consolation was in being assured that Edmund had\r\nwished for her very much, and that he should certainly have come back\r\nfor her, had she not been tired already; but this was not quite\r\nsufficient to do away with the pain of having been left a whole hour,\r\nwhen he had talked of only a few minutes, nor to banish the sort of\r\ncuriosity she felt to know what they had been conversing about all that\r\ntime; and the result of the whole was to her disappointment and\r\ndepression, as they prepared by general agreement to return to the\r\nhouse.', 'Mrs. Norris gave the\r\nparticulars of the letters, and the subject was dropt; but after tea,\r\nas Miss Crawford was standing at an open window with Edmund and Fanny\r\nlooking out on a twilight scene, while the Miss Bertrams, Mr.\r\nRushworth, and Henry Crawford were all busy with candles at the\r\npianoforte, she suddenly revived it by turning round towards the group,\r\nand saying, “How happy Mr. Rushworth looks!', '“Your father’s return will be a very interesting event.”\r\n\r\n“It will, indeed, after such an absence; an absence not only long, but\r\nincluding so many dangers.”\r\n\r\n“It will be the forerunner also of other interesting events: your\r\nsister’s marriage, and your taking orders.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be affronted,” said she, laughing, “but it does put me in mind\r\nof some of the old heathen heroes, who, after performing great exploits\r\nin a foreign land, offered sacrifices to the gods on their safe\r\nreturn.”\r\n\r\n“There is no sacrifice in the case,” replied Edmund, with a serious\r\nsmile, and glancing at the pianoforte again; “it is entirely her own\r\ndoing.”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes I know it is.', 'Nobody can wonder that men are soldiers\r\nand sailors.”\r\n\r\n“But the motives of a man who takes orders with the certainty of\r\npreferment may be fairly suspected, you think?” said Edmund.', 'It must make him think;\r\nand I have no doubt that he oftener endeavours to restrain himself than\r\nhe would if he had been anything but a clergyman.”\r\n\r\n“We cannot prove to the contrary, to be sure; but I wish you a better\r\nfate, Miss Price, than to be the wife of a man whose amiableness\r\ndepends upon his own sermons; for though he may preach himself into a\r\ngood-humour every Sunday, it will be bad enough to have him quarrelling\r\nabout green geese from Monday morning till Saturday night.”\r\n\r\n“I think the man who could often quarrel with Fanny,” said Edmund\r\naffectionately, “must be beyond the reach of any sermons.”\r\n\r\nFanny turned farther into the window; and Miss Crawford had only time\r\nto say, in a pleasant manner, “I fancy Miss Price has been more used to\r\ndeserve praise than to hear it”; when, being earnestly invited by the\r\nMiss Bertrams to join in a glee, she tripped off to the instrument,\r\nleaving Edmund looking after her in an ecstasy of admiration of all her\r\nmany virtues, from her obliging manners down to her light and graceful\r\ntread.', 'He is used to much gayer places than Mansfield.”\r\n\r\n“It is to his credit,” was Edmund’s answer; “and I dare say it gives\r\nhis sister pleasure.', 'Crawford has too much sense to stay here if he found\r\nhimself in any danger from Maria; and I am not at all afraid for her,\r\nafter such a proof as she has given that her feelings are not strong.”\r\n\r\nFanny supposed she must have been mistaken, and meant to think\r\ndifferently in future; but with all that submission to Edmund could do,\r\nand all the help of the coinciding looks and hints which she\r\noccasionally noticed in some of the others, and which seemed to say\r\nthat Julia was Mr. Crawford’s choice, she knew not always what to\r\nthink.', 'How she had looked before, Fanny could not recollect, for she\r\nhad been dancing with Edmund herself, and had not thought about her.', 'Many parts of our best plays are independent of scenery.”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” said Edmund, who began to listen with alarm.', 'If we do not outdo Ecclesford, we do\r\nnothing.”\r\n\r\n“Now, Edmund, do not be disagreeable,” said Julia.', 'Tom, returning from them into the drawing-room, where Edmund was\r\nstanding thoughtfully by the fire, while Lady Bertram was on the sofa\r\nat a little distance, and Fanny close beside her arranging her work,\r\nthus began as he entered—“Such a horribly vile billiard-table as ours\r\nis not to be met with, I believe, above ground.', 'It seems to\r\njoin the billiard-room on purpose.”\r\n\r\n“You are not serious, Tom, in meaning to act?” said Edmund, in a low\r\nvoice, as his brother approached the fire.', 'Well, Edmund,” he continued,\r\nreturning to the former subject, posture, and voice, as soon as Lady\r\nBertram began to nod again, “but _this_ I _will_ maintain, that we\r\nshall be doing no harm.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot agree with you; I am convinced that my father would totally\r\ndisapprove it.”\r\n\r\n“And I am convinced to the contrary.', 'Manage your own concerns, Edmund, and I’ll take care of the rest\r\nof the family.”\r\n\r\n“If you are resolved on acting,” replied the persevering Edmund, “I\r\nmust hope it will be in a very small and quiet way; and I think a\r\ntheatre ought not to be attempted.', 'Don’t act yourself, if you do\r\nnot like it, but don’t expect to govern everybody else.”\r\n\r\n“No, as to acting myself,” said Edmund, “_that_ I absolutely protest\r\nagainst.”\r\n\r\nTom walked out of the room as he said it, and Edmund was left to sit\r\ndown and stir the fire in thoughtful vexation.', 'Fanny, who had heard it all, and borne Edmund company in every feeling\r\nthroughout the whole, now ventured to say, in her anxiety to suggest\r\nsome comfort, “Perhaps they may not be able to find any play to suit\r\nthem.', 'No want of understrappers: my sister desires her love, and\r\nhopes to be admitted into the company, and will be happy to take the\r\npart of any old duenna or tame confidante, that you may not like to do\r\nyourselves.”\r\n\r\nMaria gave Edmund a glance, which meant, “What say you now?', 'Can we be\r\nwrong if Mary Crawford feels the same?” And Edmund, silenced, was\r\nobliged to acknowledge that the charm of acting might well carry\r\nfascination to the mind of genius; and with the ingenuity of love, to\r\ndwell more on the obliging, accommodating purport of the message than\r\non anything else.', 'CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nFanny seemed nearer being right than Edmund had supposed.', 'An enormous roll of green baize had arrived from\r\nNorthampton, and been cut out by Mrs. Norris (with a saving by her good\r\nmanagement of full three-quarters of a yard), and was actually forming\r\ninto a curtain by the housemaids, and still the play was wanting; and\r\nas two or three days passed away in this manner, Edmund began almost to\r\nhope that none might ever be found.', 'Agatha and\r\nAmelia appeared to her in their different ways so totally improper for\r\nhome representation—the situation of one, and the language of the\r\nother, so unfit to be expressed by any woman of modesty, that she could\r\nhardly suppose her cousins could be aware of what they were engaging\r\nin; and longed to have them roused as soon as possible by the\r\nremonstrance which Edmund would certainly make.', 'Thus much was settled before Edmund, who had been out all the morning,\r\nknew anything of the matter; but when he entered the drawing-room\r\nbefore dinner, the buzz of discussion was high between Tom, Maria, and\r\nMr. Yates; and Mr. Rushworth stepped forward with great alacrity to\r\ntell him the agreeable news.', 'I do not know how I shall like it.”\r\n\r\nFanny’s eyes followed Edmund, and her heart beat for him as she heard\r\nthis speech, and saw his look, and felt what his sensations must be.', 'We have cast almost every part.”\r\n\r\n“But what do you do for women?” said Edmund gravely, and looking at\r\nMaria.', 'Maria blushed in spite of herself as she answered, “I take the part\r\nwhich Lady Ravenshaw was to have done, and” (with a bolder eye) “Miss\r\nCrawford is to be Amelia.”\r\n\r\n“I should not have thought it the sort of play to be so easily filled\r\nup, with _us_,” replied Edmund, turning away to the fire, where sat his\r\nmother, aunt, and Fanny, and seating himself with a look of great\r\nvexation.', 'In a few minutes Mr. Bertram was called\r\nout of the room to satisfy some doubts of the carpenter; and being\r\naccompanied by Mr. Yates, and followed soon afterwards by Mr.\r\nRushworth, Edmund almost immediately took the opportunity of saying, “I\r\ncannot, before Mr. Yates, speak what I feel as to this play, without\r\nreflecting on his friends at Ecclesford; but I must now, my dear Maria,\r\ntell _you_, that I think it exceedingly unfit for private\r\nrepresentation, and that I hope you will give it up.', 'In all points of decorum _your_ conduct must be law to the rest of\r\nthe party.”\r\n\r\nThis picture of her consequence had some effect, for no one loved\r\nbetter to lead than Maria; and with far more good-humour she answered,\r\n“I am much obliged to you, Edmund; you mean very well, I am sure: but I\r\nstill think you see things too strongly; and I really cannot undertake\r\nto harangue all the rest upon a subject of this kind.', '“Sir Thomas\r\nwould not like it.—Fanny, ring the bell; I must have my dinner.—To be\r\nsure, Julia is dressed by this time.”\r\n\r\n“I am convinced, madam,” said Edmund, preventing Fanny, “that Sir\r\nThomas would not like it.”\r\n\r\n“There, my dear, do you hear what Edmund says?”\r\n\r\n“If I were to decline the part,” said Maria, with renewed zeal, “Julia\r\nwould certainly take it.”\r\n\r\n“What!” cried Edmund, “if she knew your reasons!”\r\n\r\n“Oh!', 'Mrs. Norris related again her triumph over Dick\r\nJackson, but neither play nor preparation were otherwise much talked\r\nof, for Edmund’s disapprobation was felt even by his brother, though he\r\nwould not have owned it.', 'She was very civilly answered by Lady Bertram, but Edmund said nothing.', 'Mr. Edmund Bertram, as\r\nyou do not act yourself, you will be a disinterested adviser; and,\r\ntherefore, I apply to _you_.', 'You must\r\nget a brown gown, and a white apron, and a mob cap, and we must make\r\nyou a few wrinkles, and a little of the crowsfoot at the corner of your\r\neyes, and you will be a very proper, little old woman.”\r\n\r\n“You must excuse me, indeed you must excuse me,” cried Fanny, growing\r\nmore and more red from excessive agitation, and looking distressfully\r\nat Edmund, who was kindly observing her; but unwilling to exasperate\r\nhis brother by interference, gave her only an encouraging smile.', 'Take the part with a good grace, and let us hear no\r\nmore of the matter, I entreat.”\r\n\r\n“Do not urge her, madam,” said Edmund.', 'By a look at her brother she\r\nprevented any farther entreaty from the theatrical board, and the\r\nreally good feelings by which she was almost purely governed were\r\nrapidly restoring her to all the little she had lost in Edmund’s\r\nfavour.', 'Tom Oliver is a very\r\nclever fellow, and Charles Maddox is as gentlemanlike a man as you will\r\nsee anywhere, so I will take my horse early to-morrow morning and ride\r\nover to Stoke, and settle with one of them.”\r\n\r\nWhile he spoke, Maria was looking apprehensively round at Edmund in\r\nfull expectation that he must oppose such an enlargement of the plan as\r\nthis: so contrary to all their first protestations; but Edmund said\r\nnothing.', 'Tom repeated his resolution of going\r\nto him early on the morrow; and though Julia, who had scarcely opened\r\nher lips before, observed, in a sarcastic manner, and with a glance\r\nfirst at Maria and then at Edmund, that “the Mansfield theatricals\r\nwould enliven the whole neighbourhood exceedingly,” Edmund still held\r\nhis peace, and shewed his feelings only by a determined gravity.', 'Miss Crawford had protected her only for the time; and\r\nif she were applied to again among themselves with all the\r\nauthoritative urgency that Tom and Maria were capable of, and Edmund\r\nperhaps away, what should she do?', 'Everything was a friend, or\r\nbore her thoughts to a friend; and though there had been sometimes much\r\nof suffering to her; though her motives had often been misunderstood,\r\nher feelings disregarded, and her comprehension undervalued; though she\r\nhad known the pains of tyranny, of ridicule, and neglect, yet almost\r\nevery recurrence of either had led to something consolatory: her aunt\r\nBertram had spoken for her, or Miss Lee had been encouraging, or, what\r\nwas yet more frequent or more dear, Edmund had been her champion and\r\nher friend: he had supported her cause or explained her meaning, he had\r\ntold her not to cry, or had given her some proof of affection which\r\nmade her tears delightful; and the whole was now so blended together,\r\nso harmonised by distance, that every former affliction had its charm.', 'To this nest of comforts Fanny now walked down to try its influence on\r\nan agitated, doubting spirit, to see if by looking at Edmund’s profile\r\nshe could catch any of his counsel, or by giving air to her geraniums\r\nshe might inhale a breeze of mental strength herself.', 'And would Edmund’s judgment, would his\r\npersuasion of Sir Thomas’s disapprobation of the whole, be enough to\r\njustify her in a determined denial in spite of all the rest?', 'Her eyes brightened at the sight of Edmund.', 'Her conscience stopt her in\r\nthe middle, but Edmund was satisfied.', 'Such a\r\nvictory over Edmund’s discretion had been beyond their hopes, and was\r\nmost delightful.', 'A stranger among them would have been the\r\ndestruction of all their comfort”; and when Edmund, pursuing that idea,\r\ngave a hint of his hope as to the limitation of the audience, they were\r\nready, in the complaisance of the moment, to promise anything.', 'There were not fewer smiles at the Parsonage than at the Park on this\r\nchange in Edmund; Miss Crawford looked very lovely in hers, and entered\r\nwith such an instantaneous renewal of cheerfulness into the whole\r\naffair as could have but one effect on him.', 'One\r\nadvantage resulted from it to Fanny: at the earnest request of Miss\r\nCrawford, Mrs. Grant had, with her usual good-humour, agreed to\r\nundertake the part for which Fanny had been wanted; and this was all\r\nthat occurred to gladden _her_ heart during the day; and even this,\r\nwhen imparted by Edmund, brought a pang with it, for it was Miss\r\nCrawford to whom she was obliged—it was Miss Crawford whose kind\r\nexertions were to excite her gratitude, and whose merit in making them\r\nwas spoken of with a glow of admiration.', 'Her heart and her judgment were equally\r\nagainst Edmund’s decision: she could not acquit his unsteadiness, and\r\nhis happiness under it made her wretched.', '_She_ knew that Mr. Yates was in general thought to rant\r\ndreadfully; that Mr. Yates was disappointed in Henry Crawford; that Tom\r\nBertram spoke so quick he would be unintelligible; that Mrs. Grant\r\nspoiled everything by laughing; that Edmund was behindhand with his\r\npart, and that it was misery to have anything to do with Mr. Rushworth,\r\nwho was wanting a prompter through every speech.', 'As far as she could judge, Mr. Crawford was considerably the best actor\r\nof all: he had more confidence than Edmund, more judgment than Tom,\r\nmore talent and taste than Mr. Yates.', 'Fanny did not share her\r\naunt’s composure: she thought of the morrow a great deal, for if the\r\nthree acts were rehearsed, Edmund and Miss Crawford would then be\r\nacting together for the first time; the third act would bring a scene\r\nbetween them which interested her most particularly, and which she was\r\nlonging and dreading to see how they would perform.', 'I came here to-day intending to rehearse it with Edmund—by\r\nourselves—against the evening, but he is not in the way; and if he\r\n_were_, I do not think I could go through it with _him_, till I have\r\nhardened myself a little; for really there is a speech or two.', 'Now for my soliloquy.”\r\n\r\nShe began, and Fanny joined in with all the modest feeling which the\r\nidea of representing Edmund was so strongly calculated to inspire; but\r\nwith looks and voice so truly feminine as to be no very good picture of\r\na man.', 'With such an Anhalt, however, Miss Crawford had courage enough;\r\nand they had got through half the scene, when a tap at the door brought\r\na pause, and the entrance of Edmund, the next moment, suspended it all.', 'Surprise, consciousness, and pleasure appeared in each of the three on\r\nthis unexpected meeting; and as Edmund was come on the very same\r\nbusiness that had brought Miss Crawford, consciousness and pleasure\r\nwere likely to be more than momentary in _them_.', 'Tom was enjoying\r\nsuch an advance towards the end; Edmund was in spirits from the\r\nmorning’s rehearsal, and little vexations seemed everywhere smoothed\r\naway.', 'After a pause of perplexity, some eyes\r\nbegan to be turned towards Fanny, and a voice or two to say, “If Miss\r\nPrice would be so good as to _read_ the part.” She was immediately\r\nsurrounded by supplications; everybody asked it; even Edmund said, “Do,\r\nFanny, if it is not _very_ disagreeable to you.”\r\n\r\nBut Fanny still hung back.', 'She was nearly fainting: all her\r\nformer habitual dread of her uncle was returning, and with it\r\ncompassion for him and for almost every one of the party on the\r\ndevelopment before him, with solicitude on Edmund’s account\r\nindescribable.', 'The first day I went over Mansfield Wood,\r\nand Edmund took the copses beyond Easton, and we brought home six brace\r\nbetween us, and might each have killed six times as many, but we\r\nrespect your pheasants, sir, I assure you, as much as you could desire.', 'of\r\nunquietness, but prevented him even from seeing the expression of the\r\nface on which his own eyes were fixed—from seeing Sir Thomas’s dark\r\nbrow contract as he looked with inquiring earnestness at his daughters\r\nand Edmund, dwelling particularly on the latter, and speaking a\r\nlanguage, a remonstrance, a reproof, which _he_ felt at his heart.', 'Such a look of reproach at Edmund from his\r\nfather she could never have expected to witness; and to feel that it\r\nwas in any degree deserved was an aggravation indeed.', 'Sir Thomas’s look\r\nimplied, “On your judgment, Edmund, I depended; what have you been\r\nabout?” She knelt in spirit to her uncle, and her bosom swelled to\r\nutter, “Oh, not to _him_!', 'You will find Fanny everything you could wish.”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas saw all the impropriety of such a scheme among such a party,\r\nand at such a time, as strongly as his son had ever supposed he must;\r\nhe felt it too much, indeed, for many words; and having shaken hands\r\nwith Edmund, meant to try to lose the disagreeable impression, and\r\nforget how much he had been forgotten himself as soon as he could,\r\nafter the house had been cleared of every object enforcing the\r\nremembrance, and restored to its proper state.', 'The young people had been very inconsiderate in forming\r\nthe plan; they ought to have been capable of a better decision\r\nthemselves; but they were young; and, excepting Edmund, he believed, of\r\nunsteady characters; and with greater surprise, therefore, he must\r\nregard her acquiescence in their wrong measures, her countenance of\r\ntheir unsafe amusements, than that such measures and such amusements\r\nshould have been suggested.', 'She had a\r\ngreat deal to insinuate in her own praise as to _general_ attention to\r\nthe interest and comfort of his family, much exertion and many\r\nsacrifices to glance at in the form of hurried walks and sudden\r\nremovals from her own fireside, and many excellent hints of distrust\r\nand economy to Lady Bertram and Edmund to detail, whereby a most\r\nconsiderable saving had always arisen, and more than one bad servant\r\nbeen detected.', 'By all the others it was mentioned\r\nwith regret; and his merits honoured with due gradation of feeling—from\r\nthe sincerity of Edmund’s too partial regard, to the unconcern of his\r\nmother speaking entirely by rote.', 'And besides, I want to play\r\nsomething more to you—a very pretty piece—and your cousin Edmund’s\r\nprime favourite.', 'You must stay and hear your cousin’s favourite.”\r\n\r\nFanny felt that she must; and though she had not waited for that\r\nsentence to be thinking of Edmund, such a memento made her particularly\r\nawake to his idea, and she fancied him sitting in that room again and\r\nagain, perhaps in the very spot where she sat now, listening with\r\nconstant delight to the favourite air, played, as it appeared to her,\r\nwith superior tone and expression; and though pleased with it herself,\r\nand glad to like whatever was liked by him, she was more sincerely\r\nimpatient to go away at the conclusion of it than she had been before;\r\nand on this being evident, she was so kindly asked to call again, to\r\ntake them in her walk whenever she could, to come and hear more of the\r\nharp, that she felt it necessary to be done, if no objection arose at\r\nhome.', 'here he is.” It was not Mr. Rushworth, however, but Edmund, who then\r\nappeared walking towards them with Mrs. Grant.', 'But there is\r\nnobleness in the name of Edmund.', 'It is a name of heroism and renown; of\r\nkings, princes, and knights; and seems to breathe the spirit of\r\nchivalry and warm affections.”\r\n\r\n“I grant you the name is good in itself, and _Lord_ Edmund or _Sir_\r\nEdmund sound delightfully; but sink it under the chill, the\r\nannihilation of a Mr., and Mr. Edmund is no more than Mr. John or Mr.\r\nThomas.', 'What do you think we have been sitting down for but to be\r\ntalked to about it, and entreated and supplicated never to do so\r\nagain?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps I might have scolded,” said Edmund, “if either of you had been\r\nsitting down alone; but while you do wrong together, I can overlook a\r\ngreat deal.”\r\n\r\n“They cannot have been sitting long,” cried Mrs. Grant, “for when I\r\nwent up for my shawl I saw them from the staircase window, and then\r\nthey were walking.”\r\n\r\n“And really,” added Edmund, “the day is so mild, that your sitting down\r\nfor a few minutes can be hardly thought imprudent.', 'It\r\ncertainly may secure all the myrtle and turkey part of it.”\r\n\r\n“You intend to be very rich?” said Edmund, with a look which, to\r\nFanny’s eye, had a great deal of serious meaning.', 'With undoubting decision she\r\ndirectly began her adieus; and Edmund began at the same time to\r\nrecollect that his mother had been inquiring for her, and that he had\r\nwalked down to the Parsonage on purpose to bring her back.', 'Fanny’s hurry increased; and without in the least expecting Edmund’s\r\nattendance, she would have hastened away alone; but the general pace\r\nwas quickened, and they all accompanied her into the house, through\r\nwhich it was necessary to pass.', 'Dr. Grant was in the vestibule, and as\r\nthey stopt to speak to him she found, from Edmund’s manner, that he\r\n_did_ mean to go with her.', 'In the moment of parting, Edmund was invited by Dr. Grant\r\nto eat his mutton with him the next day; and Fanny had barely time for\r\nan unpleasant feeling on the occasion, when Mrs. Grant, with sudden\r\nrecollection, turned to her and asked for the pleasure of her company\r\ntoo.', 'But Edmund, delighted with her having\r\nsuch an happiness offered, and ascertaining with half a look, and half\r\na sentence, that she had no objection but on her aunt’s account, could\r\nnot imagine that his mother would make any difficulty of sparing her,\r\nand therefore gave his decided open advice that the invitation should\r\nbe accepted; and though Fanny would not venture, even on his\r\nencouragement, to such a flight of audacious independence, it was soon\r\nsettled, that if nothing were heard to the contrary, Mrs. Grant might\r\nexpect her.', 'A turkey, or a goose, or a leg of mutton, or\r\nwhatever you and your cook chuse to give us.”\r\n\r\nThe two cousins walked home together; and, except in the immediate\r\ndiscussion of this engagement, which Edmund spoke of with the warmest\r\nsatisfaction, as so particularly desirable for her in the intimacy\r\nwhich he saw with so much pleasure established, it was a silent walk;\r\nfor having finished that subject, he grew thoughtful and indisposed for\r\nany other.', 'Fanny, you do not want to go, do you?”\r\n\r\n“If you put such a question to her,” cried Edmund, preventing his\r\ncousin’s speaking, “Fanny will immediately say No; but I am sure, my\r\ndear mother, she would like to go; and I can see no reason why she\r\nshould not.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot imagine why Mrs. Grant should think of asking her?', 'So I will, Edmund.', 'for Mrs. Grant never used to ask her.”\r\n\r\n“But is it not very natural,” observed Edmund, “that Mrs. Grant should\r\nwish to procure so agreeable a visitor for her sister?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing can be more natural,” said Sir Thomas, after a short\r\ndeliberation; “nor, were there no sister in the case, could anything,\r\nin my opinion, be more natural.', 'But as I conclude that she\r\nmust wish to go, since all young people like to be together, I can see\r\nno reason why she should be denied the indulgence.”\r\n\r\n“But can I do without her, Sir Thomas?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed I think you may.”\r\n\r\n“She always makes tea, you know, when my sister is not here.”\r\n\r\n“Your sister, perhaps, may be prevailed on to spend the day with us,\r\nand I shall certainly be at home.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, then, Fanny may go, Edmund.”\r\n\r\nThe good news soon followed her.', 'And as to coming away at night,\r\nyou are to stay just as long as Edmund chuses.', 'But Edmund goes; true, it is\r\nupon Edmund’s account.', '“Now I must look at you, Fanny,” said Edmund, with the kind smile of an\r\naffectionate brother, “and tell you how I like you; and as well as I\r\ncan judge by this light, you look very nicely indeed.', '“Heyday!” said Edmund, “here’s company, here’s a carriage!', 'A\r\nvery cordial meeting passed between him and Edmund; and with the\r\nexception of Fanny, the pleasure was general; and even to _her_ there\r\nmight be some advantage in his presence, since every addition to the\r\nparty must rather forward her favourite indulgence of being suffered to\r\nsit silent and unattended to.', 'She heard them\r\nspoken of by him only in a general way, till they were all re-assembled\r\nin the drawing-room, when Edmund, being engaged apart in some matter of\r\nbusiness with Dr. Grant, which seemed entirely to engross them, and\r\nMrs. Grant occupied at the tea-table, he began talking of them with\r\nmore particularity to his other sister.', 'what a corrupted mind!”\r\n\r\n“We were unlucky, Miss Price,” he continued, in a lower tone, to avoid\r\nthe possibility of being heard by Edmund, and not at all aware of her\r\nfeelings, “we certainly were very unlucky.', 'Miss Crawford, who had been repeatedly eyeing Dr. Grant and Edmund, now\r\nobserved, “Those gentlemen must have some very interesting point to\r\ndiscuss.”\r\n\r\n“The most interesting in the world,” replied her brother—“how to make\r\nmoney; how to turn a good income into a better.', 'You must preach at Mansfield, you know, that\r\nSir Thomas and Lady Bertram may hear you.”\r\n\r\n“I shall keep clear of you, Crawford, as long as I can,” said Edmund;\r\n“for you would be more likely to disconcert me, and I should be more\r\nsorry to see you trying at it than almost any other man.”\r\n\r\n“Will he not feel this?” thought Fanny.', 'The assurance of Edmund’s being so soon to take orders, coming upon her\r\nlike a blow that had been suspended, and still hoped uncertain and at a\r\ndistance, was felt with resentment and mortification.', 'This was\r\nexactly what Sir Thomas and Edmund had been separately conniving at, as\r\neach proved to the other by the sympathetic alacrity with which they\r\nboth advised Mrs. Norris’s continuing where she was, instead of rushing\r\nout into the hall as soon as the noises of the arrival reached them.', 'On the morrow they were walking about together with true\r\nenjoyment, and every succeeding morrow renewed a _tête-à-tête_ which\r\nSir Thomas could not but observe with complacency, even before Edmund\r\nhad pointed it out to him.', 'Excepting the moments of peculiar delight, which any marked or\r\nunlooked-for instance of Edmund’s consideration of her in the last few\r\nmonths had excited, Fanny had never known so much felicity in her life,\r\nas in this unchecked, equal, fearless intercourse with the brother and\r\nfriend who was opening all his heart to her, telling her all his hopes\r\nand fears, plans, and solicitudes respecting that long thought of,\r\ndearly earned, and justly valued blessing of promotion; who could give\r\nher direct and minute information of the father and mother, brothers\r\nand sisters, of whom she very seldom heard; who was interested in all\r\nthe comforts and all the little hardships of her home at Mansfield;\r\nready to think of every member of that home as she directed, or\r\ndiffering only by a less scrupulous opinion, and more noisy abuse of\r\ntheir aunt Norris, and with whom (perhaps the dearest indulgence of the\r\nwhole) all the evil and good of their earliest years could be gone over\r\nagain, and every former united pain and pleasure retraced with the\r\nfondest recollection.', 'He was roused from the reverie\r\nof retrospection and regret produced by it, by some inquiry from Edmund\r\nas to his plans for the next day’s hunting; and he found it was as well\r\nto be a man of fortune at once with horses and grooms at his command.', 'I found myself, in short, in Thornton Lacey.”\r\n\r\n“It sounds like it,” said Edmund; “but which way did you turn after\r\npassing Sewell’s farm?”\r\n\r\n“I answer no such irrelevant and insidious questions; though were I to\r\nanswer all that you could put in the course of an hour, you would never\r\nbe able to prove that it was _not_ Thornton Lacey—for such it certainly\r\nwas.”\r\n\r\n“You inquired, then?”\r\n\r\n“No, I never inquire.', '“Well,” continued Edmund, “and how did you like what you saw?”\r\n\r\n“Very much indeed.', 'I had two or three ideas.”\r\n\r\n“And I have two or three ideas also,” said Edmund, “and one of them is,\r\nthat very little of your plan for Thornton Lacey will ever be put in\r\npractice.', 'It is\r\nnot a scrambling collection of low single rooms, with as many roofs as\r\nwindows; it is not cramped into the vulgar compactness of a square\r\nfarmhouse: it is a solid, roomy, mansion-like looking house, such as\r\none might suppose a respectable old country family had lived in from\r\ngeneration to generation, through two centuries at least, and were now\r\nspending from two to three thousand a year in.” Miss Crawford listened,\r\nand Edmund agreed to this.', 'The game will be yours,” turning to her again; “it\r\nwill certainly be yours.”\r\n\r\n“And Fanny had much rather it were William’s,” said Edmund, smiling at\r\nher.', 'Henry Crawford was in the first glow of another scheme about Thornton\r\nLacey; and not being able to catch Edmund’s ear, was detailing it to\r\nhis fair neighbour with a look of considerable earnestness.', 'May I hope for your acquiescence, and for your\r\nnot influencing your son against such a tenant?”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas, politely bowing, replied, “It is the only way, sir, in\r\nwhich I could _not_ wish you established as a permanent neighbour; but\r\nI hope, and believe, that Edmund will occupy his own house at Thornton\r\nLacey.', '“Sir Thomas,” said Edmund, “undoubtedly understands the duty of a\r\nparish priest.', 'One of\r\nwhom, having never before understood that Thornton was so soon and so\r\ncompletely to be his home, was pondering with downcast eyes on what it\r\nwould be _not_ to see Edmund every day; and the other, startled from\r\nthe agreeable fancies she had been previously indulging on the strength\r\nof her brother’s description, no longer able, in the picture she had\r\nbeen forming of a future Thornton, to shut out the church, sink the\r\nclergyman, and see only the respectable, elegant, modernised, and\r\noccasional residence of a man of independent fortune, was considering\r\nSir Thomas, with decided ill-will, as the destroyer of all this, and\r\nsuffering the more from that involuntary forbearance which his\r\ncharacter and manner commanded, and from not daring to relieve herself\r\nby a single attempt at throwing ridicule on his cause.', 'My dear\r\nSir Thomas, we have settled it that the carriage should come back for\r\nyou, and Edmund and William.”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas could not dissent, as it had been his own arrangement,\r\npreviously communicated to his wife and sister; but _that_ seemed\r\nforgotten by Mrs. Norris, who must fancy that she settled it all\r\nherself.', 'Fanny’s last feeling in the visit was disappointment: for the shawl\r\nwhich Edmund was quietly taking from the servant to bring and put round\r\nher shoulders was seized by Mr. Crawford’s quicker hand, and she was\r\nobliged to be indebted to his more prominent attention.', 'With such matters to ponder over, and arrange, and re-arrange, Edmund\r\ncould not, on his own account, think very much of the evening which the\r\nrest of the family were looking forward to with a more equal degree of\r\nstrong interest.', 'Thursday was the day of the ball; and on Wednesday morning Fanny, still\r\nunable to satisfy herself as to what she ought to wear, determined to\r\nseek the counsel of the more enlightened, and apply to Mrs. Grant and\r\nher sister, whose acknowledged taste would certainly bear her\r\nblameless; and as Edmund and William were gone to Northampton, and she\r\nhad reason to think Mr. Crawford likewise out, she walked down to the\r\nParsonage without much fear of wanting an opportunity for private\r\ndiscussion; and the privacy of such a discussion was a most important\r\npart of it to Fanny, being more than half-ashamed of her own\r\nsolicitude.', 'It is without a drawback.”\r\n\r\nUpon such expressions of affection Fanny could have lived an hour\r\nwithout saying another word; but Edmund, after waiting a moment,\r\nobliged her to bring down her mind from its heavenly flight by saying,\r\n“But what is it that you want to consult me about?”\r\n\r\nIt was about the necklace, which she was now most earnestly longing to\r\nreturn, and hoped to obtain his approbation of her doing.', 'She gave the\r\nhistory of her recent visit, and now her raptures might well be over;\r\nfor Edmund was so struck with the circumstance, so delighted with what\r\nMiss Crawford had done, so gratified by such a coincidence of conduct\r\nbetween them, that Fanny could not but admit the superior power of one\r\npleasure over his own mind, though it might have its drawback.', 'It was her intention, as she felt it to be her duty, to try to overcome\r\nall that was excessive, all that bordered on selfishness, in her\r\naffection for Edmund.', 'Never were such characters\r\ncut by any other human being as Edmund’s commonest handwriting gave!', 'To dance without much observation or any\r\nextraordinary fatigue, to have strength and partners for about half the\r\nevening, to dance a little with Edmund, and not a great deal with Mr.\r\nCrawford, to see William enjoy himself, and be able to keep away from\r\nher aunt Norris, was the height of her ambition, and seemed to\r\ncomprehend her greatest possibility of happiness.', 'Starting and looking up,\r\nshe saw, across the lobby she had just reached, Edmund himself,\r\nstanding at the head of a different staircase.', '“I come from Dr. Grant’s,” said Edmund presently.', '“Dearest Fanny!” cried Edmund, pressing her hand to his lips with\r\nalmost as much warmth as if it had been Miss Crawford’s, “you are all\r\nconsiderate thought!', 'She had, to oblige Edmund, resolved to wear it; but it was too\r\nlarge for the purpose.', 'His, therefore, must be worn; and having, with\r\ndelightful feelings, joined the chain and the cross—those memorials of\r\nthe two most beloved of her heart, those dearest tokens so formed for\r\neach other by everything real and imaginary—and put them round her\r\nneck, and seen and felt how full of William and Edmund they were, she\r\nwas able, without an effort, to resolve on wearing Miss Crawford’s\r\nnecklace too.', 'From a variety of causes she was happy, and she was soon made\r\nstill happier; for in following her aunts out of the room, Edmund, who\r\nwas holding open the door, said, as she passed him, “You must dance\r\nwith me, Fanny; you must keep two dances for me; any two that you like,\r\nexcept the first.” She had nothing more to wish for.', 'It was but\r\nto think of her conversation with Edmund, and what was the restlessness\r\nof Mrs. Norris?', 'Fanny felt that there must be a\r\nstruggle in Edmund’s cheerfulness, but it was delightful to see the\r\neffort so successfully made.', 'Fanny felt the advantage;

she was happy\r\nin knowing herself admired; and she was happy in having the two dances\r\nwith Edmund still to look forward to, during the greatest part of the\r\nevening, her hand being so eagerly sought after that her indefinite\r\nengagement with _him_ was in continual perspective.', 'The evening had afforded Edmund little pleasure.', 'It was barbarous to be happy when Edmund was suffering.', 'Soon after the second breakfast, Edmund\r\nbade them good-bye for a week, and mounted his horse for Peterborough,\r\nand then all were gone.', 'Angry as she was with Edmund for adhering to his own notions, and\r\nacting on them in defiance of her (and she had been so angry that they\r\nhad hardly parted friends at the ball), she could not help thinking of\r\nhim continually when absent, dwelling on his merit and affection, and\r\nlonging again for the almost daily meetings they lately had.', 'All this was bad, but she had\r\nstill more to feel when Friday came round again and brought no Edmund;\r\nwhen Saturday came and still no Edmund; and when, through the slight\r\ncommunication with the other family which Sunday produced, she learned\r\nthat he had actually written home to defer his return, having promised\r\nto remain some days longer with his friend.', 'But at\r\nlast Lady Bertram left the room, and then almost immediately Miss\r\nCrawford thus began, with a voice as well regulated as she could—“And\r\nhow do _you_ like your cousin Edmund’s staying away so long?', 'Was there one of the family,\r\nexcepting Edmund, who had not in some way or other continually\r\nexercised her patience and forbearance?', 'Her cousin Edmund never forgets her.”\r\n\r\n“Edmund!', 'What can Sir Thomas and Edmund together\r\ndo, what _do_ they do for her happiness, comfort, honour, and dignity\r\nin the world, to what I _shall_ do?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry Crawford was at Mansfield Park again the next morning, and at an\r\nearlier hour than common visiting warrants.', 'Crawford called the next day, and on the score of Edmund’s return, Sir\r\nThomas felt himself more than licensed to ask him to stay dinner; it\r\nwas really a necessary compliment.', 'He staid of course, and Edmund had\r\nthen ample opportunity for observing how he sped with Fanny, and what\r\ndegree of immediate encouragement for him might be extracted from her\r\nmanners; and it was so little, so very, very little—every chance, every\r\npossibility of it, resting upon her embarrassment only; if there was\r\nnot hope in her confusion, there was hope in nothing else—that he was\r\nalmost ready to wonder at his friend’s perseverance.', 'To _good_ reading, however, she had\r\nbeen long used: her uncle read well, her cousins all, Edmund very well,\r\nbut in Mr. Crawford’s reading there was a variety of excellence beyond\r\nwhat she had ever met with.', 'Then she was shrinking again into\r\nherself, and blushing and working as hard as ever; but it had been\r\nenough to give Edmund encouragement for his friend, and as he cordially\r\nthanked him, he hoped to be expressing Fanny’s secret feelings too.', 'No man of any brain can open at a good part of one of\r\nhis plays without falling into the flow of his meaning immediately.”\r\n\r\n“No doubt one is familiar with Shakespeare in a degree,” said Edmund,\r\n“from one’s earliest years.', '“Even in my profession,” said Edmund, with a smile, “how little the art\r\nof reading has been studied!', 'It is felt that distinctness and\r\nenergy may have weight in recommending the most solid truths; and\r\nbesides, there is more general observation and taste, a more critical\r\nknowledge diffused than formerly; in every congregation there is a\r\nlarger proportion who know a little of the matter, and who can judge\r\nand criticise.”\r\n\r\nEdmund had already gone through the service once since his ordination;\r\nand upon this being understood, he had a variety of questions from\r\nCrawford as to his feelings and success; questions, which being made,\r\nthough with the vivacity of friendly interest and quick taste, without\r\nany touch of that spirit of banter or air of levity which Edmund knew\r\nto be most offensive to Fanny, he had true pleasure in satisfying; and\r\nwhen Crawford proceeded to ask his opinion and give his own as to the\r\nproperest manner in which particular passages in the service should be\r\ndelivered, shewing it to be a subject on which he had thought before,\r\nand thought with judgment, Edmund was still more and more pleased.', 'And I do not know that I should be fond of\r\npreaching often; now and then, perhaps once or twice in the spring,\r\nafter being anxiously expected for half a dozen Sundays together; but\r\nnot for a constancy; it would not do for a constancy.”\r\n\r\nHere Fanny, who could not but listen, involuntarily shook her head, and\r\nCrawford was instantly by her side again, entreating to know her\r\nmeaning; and as Edmund perceived, by his drawing in a chair, and\r\nsitting down close by her, that it was to be a very thorough attack,\r\nthat looks and undertones were to be well tried, he sank as quietly as\r\npossible into a corner, turned his back, and took up a newspaper, very\r\nsincerely wishing that dear little Fanny might be persuaded into\r\nexplaining away that shake of the head to the satisfaction of her\r\nardent lover; and as earnestly trying to bury every sound of the\r\nbusiness from himself in murmurs of his own, over the various\r\nadvertisements of “A most desirable Estate in South Wales”; “To Parents\r\nand Guardians”; and a “Capital season’d Hunter.”\r\n\r\nFanny, meanwhile, vexed with herself for not having been as motionless\r\nas she was speechless, and grieved to the heart to see Edmund’s\r\narrangements, was trying by everything in the power of her modest,\r\ngentle nature, to repulse Mr. Crawford, and avoid both his looks and\r\ninquiries; and he, unrepulsable, was persisting in both.', 'he never will succeed with me.” And she spoke\r\nwith a warmth which quite astonished Edmund, and which she blushed at\r\nthe recollection of herself, when she saw his look, and heard him\r\nreply, “Never!', 'I then saw him behaving, as it appeared\r\nto me, so very improperly and unfeelingly—I may speak of it now because\r\nit is all over—so improperly by poor Mr. Rushworth, not seeming to care\r\nhow he exposed or hurt him, and paying attentions to my cousin Maria,\r\nwhich—in short, at the time of the play, I received an impression which\r\nwill never be got over.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Fanny,” replied Edmund, scarcely hearing her to the end, “let\r\nus not, any of us, be judged by what we appeared at that period of\r\ngeneral folly.', 'She is hurt, as you would be for William; but she loves and\r\nesteems you with all her heart.”\r\n\r\n“I knew she would be very angry with me.”\r\n\r\n“My dearest Fanny,” cried Edmund, pressing her arm closer to him, “do\r\nnot let the idea of her anger distress you.', 'The promised visit from “her friend,” as Edmund called Miss Crawford,\r\nwas a formidable threat to Fanny, and she lived in continual terror of\r\nit.', 'He did not understand her: he felt that he did not; and\r\ntherefore applied to Edmund to tell him how she stood affected on the\r\npresent occasion, and whether she were more or less happy than she had\r\nbeen.', 'What chiefly surprised Edmund was, that Crawford’s sister, the friend\r\nand companion who had been so much to her, should not be more visibly\r\nregretted.', 'If she could have believed Mary’s future\r\nfate as unconnected with Mansfield as she was determined the brother’s\r\nshould be, if she could have hoped her return thither to be as distant\r\nas she was much inclined to think his, she would have been light of\r\nheart indeed; but the more she recollected and observed, the more\r\ndeeply was she convinced that everything was now in a fairer train for\r\nMiss Crawford’s marrying Edmund than it had ever been before.', 'She might\r\nlove, but she did not deserve Edmund by any other sentiment.', 'Fanny\r\nbelieved there was scarcely a second feeling in common between them;\r\nand she may be forgiven by older sages for looking on the chance of\r\nMiss Crawford’s future improvement as nearly desperate, for thinking\r\nthat if Edmund’s influence in this season of love had already done so\r\nlittle in clearing her judgment, and regulating her notions, his worth\r\nwould be finally wasted on her even in years of matrimony.', 'So\r\nthe uniform remained at Portsmouth, and Edmund conjectured that before\r\nFanny had any chance of seeing it, all its own freshness and all the\r\nfreshness of its wearer’s feelings must be worn away.', 'Afterwards, when familiarised\r\nwith the visions of enjoyment so suddenly opened, she could speak more\r\nlargely to William and Edmund of what she felt; but still there were\r\nemotions of tenderness that could not be clothed in words.', 'Lady Bertram had been telling her niece in the\r\nevening to write to her soon and often, and promising to be a good\r\ncorrespondent herself; and Edmund, at a convenient moment, then added\r\nin a whisper, “And _I_ shall write to you, Fanny, when I have anything\r\nworth writing about, anything to say that I think you will like to\r\nhear, and that you will not hear so soon from any other quarter.” Had\r\nshe doubted his meaning while she listened, the glow in his face, when\r\nshe looked up at him, would have been decisive.', 'That a letter from Edmund\r\nshould be a subject of terror!', 'She clung to her aunt, because\r\nshe would miss her; she kissed the hand of her uncle with struggling\r\nsobs, because she had displeased him; and as for Edmund, she could\r\nneither speak, nor look, nor think, when the last moment came with\r\n_him_; and it was not till it was over that she knew he was giving her\r\nthe affectionate farewell of a brother.', 'Miss Crawford’s style of writing, lively and affectionate,\r\nwas itself an evil, independent of what she was thus forced into\r\nreading from the brother’s pen, for Edmund would never rest till she\r\nhad read the chief of the letter to him; and then she had to listen to\r\nhis admiration of her language, and the warmth of her attachments.', 'When no longer under the same roof with Edmund, she trusted that Miss\r\nCrawford would have no motive for writing strong enough to overcome the\r\ntrouble, and that at Portsmouth their correspondence would dwindle into\r\nnothing.', 'They entered\r\nOxford, but she could take only a hasty glimpse of Edmund’s college as\r\nthey passed along, and made no stop anywhere till they reached Newbury,\r\nwhere a comfortable meal, uniting dinner and supper, wound up the\r\nenjoyments and fatigues of the day.', 'Such was the home which was to put Mansfield out of her head, and teach\r\nher to think of her cousin Edmund with moderated feelings.', 'Your cousin Edmund moves slowly; detained, perchance, by\r\nparish duties.', 'Her greatest wonder on the subject soon became—not\r\nthat Susan should have been provoked into disrespect and impatience\r\nagainst her better knowledge—but that so much better knowledge, so many\r\ngood notions should have been hers at all; and that, brought up in the\r\nmidst of negligence and error, she should have formed such proper\r\nopinions of what ought to be; she, who had had no cousin Edmund to\r\ndirect her thoughts or fix her principles.', 'In this occupation she hoped, moreover, to bury some of the\r\nrecollections of Mansfield, which were too apt to seize her mind if her\r\nfingers only were busy; and, especially at this time, hoped it might be\r\nuseful in diverting her thoughts from pursuing Edmund to London,\r\nwhither, on the authority of her aunt’s last letter, she knew he was\r\ngone.', 'CHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\n\r\nA week was gone since Edmund might be supposed in town, and Fanny had\r\nheard nothing of him.', 'By the time he had given all this information, it was not unreasonable\r\nto suppose that Fanny might be looked at and spoken to; and she was\r\ntolerably able to bear his eye, and hear that he had spent half an hour\r\nwith his sister the evening before his leaving London; that she had\r\nsent her best and kindest love, but had had no time for writing; that\r\nhe thought himself lucky in seeing Mary for even half an hour, having\r\nspent scarcely twenty-four hours in London, after his return from\r\nNorfolk, before he set off again; that her cousin Edmund was in town,\r\nhad been in town, he understood, a few days; that he had not seen him\r\nhimself, but that he was well, had left them all well at Mansfield, and\r\nwas to dine, as yesterday, with the Frasers.', 'And at Michaelmas, perhaps, a fourth\r\nmay be added: some small hunting-box in the vicinity of everything so\r\ndear; for as to any partnership in Thornton Lacey, as Edmund Bertram\r\nonce good-humouredly proposed, I hope I foresee two objections: two\r\nfair, excellent, irresistible objections to that plan.”\r\n\r\nFanny was doubly silenced here; though when the moment was passed,\r\ncould regret that she had not forced herself into the acknowledged\r\ncomprehension of one half of his meaning, and encouraged him to say\r\nsomething more of his sister and Edmund.', 'Good-bye; I wish you\r\na pleasant journey to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“Is there nothing I can do for you in town?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing; I am much obliged to you.”\r\n\r\n“Have you no message for anybody?”\r\n\r\n“My love to your sister, if you please; and when you see my cousin, my\r\ncousin Edmund, I wish you would be so good as to say that I suppose I\r\nshall soon hear from him.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; and if he is lazy or negligent, I will write his excuses\r\nmyself.”\r\n\r\nHe could say no more, for Fanny would be no longer detained.', 'It was parting with somebody of the nature of a friend; and though, in\r\none light, glad to have him gone, it seemed as if she was now deserted\r\nby everybody; it was a sort of renewed separation from Mansfield; and\r\nshe could not think of his returning to town, and being frequently with\r\nMary and Edmund, without feelings so near akin to envy as made her hate\r\nherself for having them.', 'He will not do by the side of\r\nyour cousin Edmund.', 'Luckily there is no distinction of dress nowadays to tell\r\ntales, but—but—but Yours affectionately.”\r\n\r\n“I had almost forgot (it was Edmund’s fault: he gets into my head more\r\nthan does me good) one very material thing I had to say from Henry and\r\nmyself—I mean about our taking you back into Northamptonshire.', 'Only keep your cousin Edmund\r\nfrom me at such a time: I should not like to be tempted.', 'CHAPTER XLIV\r\n\r\n\r\nSeven weeks of the two months were very nearly gone, when the one\r\nletter, the letter from Edmund, so long expected, was put into Fanny’s\r\nhands.', 'She was\r\nalmost vexed into displeasure and anger against Edmund.', '‘The loss of Mary I must\r\nconsider as comprehending the loss of Crawford and Fanny.’ Edmund, you\r\ndo not know me.', 'Within a few days from the receipt of Edmund’s\r\nletter, Fanny had one from her aunt, beginning thus—\r\n\r\n“My Dear Fanny,—I take up my pen to communicate some very alarming\r\nintelligence, which I make no doubt will give you much concern”.', '“This distressing intelligence, as you may suppose,” observed her\r\nladyship, after giving the substance of it, “has agitated us\r\nexceedingly, and we cannot prevent ourselves from being greatly alarmed\r\nand apprehensive for the poor invalid, whose state Sir Thomas fears may\r\nbe very critical; and Edmund kindly proposes attending his brother\r\nimmediately, but I am happy to add that Sir Thomas will not leave me on\r\nthis distressing occasion, as it would be too trying for me.', 'We shall\r\ngreatly miss Edmund in our small circle, but I trust and hope he will\r\nfind the poor invalid in a less alarming state than might be\r\napprehended, and that he will be able to bring him to Mansfield\r\nshortly, which Sir Thomas proposes should be done, and thinks best on\r\nevery account, and I flatter myself the poor sufferer will soon be able\r\nto bear the removal without material inconvenience or injury.', 'Tom dangerously ill, Edmund gone to attend him, and the sadly small\r\nparty remaining at Mansfield, were cares to shut out every other care,\r\nor almost every other.', 'She could just find selfishness enough to wonder\r\nwhether Edmund _had_ written to Miss Crawford before this summons came,\r\nbut no sentiment dwelt long with her that was not purely affectionate\r\nand disinterestedly anxious.', 'Her aunt did not neglect her: she wrote\r\nagain and again; they were receiving frequent accounts from Edmund, and\r\nthese accounts were as regularly transmitted to Fanny, in the same\r\ndiffuse style, and the same medley of trusts, hopes, and fears, all\r\nfollowing and producing each other at haphazard.', 'Lady Bertram\r\ncould think nothing less, and Fanny shared her aunt’s security, till\r\nshe received a few lines from Edmund, written purposely to give her a\r\nclearer idea of his brother’s situation, and acquaint her with the\r\napprehensions which he and his father had imbibed from the physician\r\nwith respect to some strong hectic symptoms, which seemed to seize the\r\nframe on the departure of the fever.', 'A very few lines from Edmund shewed her the patient and the sickroom in\r\na juster and stronger light than all Lady Bertram’s sheets of paper\r\ncould do.', 'She could do nothing but glide\r\nin quietly and look at him; but when able to talk or be talked to, or\r\nread to, Edmund was the companion he preferred.', 'The family were not consumptive, and she was more inclined to hope than\r\nfear for her cousin, except when she thought of Miss Crawford; but Miss\r\nCrawford gave her the idea of being the child of good luck, and to her\r\nselfishness and vanity it would be good luck to have Edmund the only\r\nson.', 'A line occasionally added by Edmund to his\r\nmother’s letter was enough for Fanny’s information.', 'She saw the proof of it in Miss\r\nCrawford, as well as in her cousins; _her_ attachment to Edmund had\r\nbeen respectable, the most respectable part of her character; her\r\nfriendship for herself had at least been blameless.', 'I put it to your\r\nconscience, whether ‘Sir Edmund’ would not do more good with all the\r\nBertram property than any other possible ‘Sir.’ Had the Grants been at\r\nhome I would not have troubled you, but you are now the only one I can\r\napply to for the truth, his sisters not being within my reach.', 'Do not you think Edmund would\r\nhave been in town again long ago, but for this illness?—Yours ever,\r\nMary.”\r\n\r\n“I had actually begun folding my letter when Henry walked in, but he\r\nbrings no intelligence to prevent my sending it.', 'I have not time or patience\r\nto give half Henry’s messages; be satisfied that the spirit of each and\r\nevery one is unalterable affection.”\r\n\r\nFanny’s disgust at the greater part of this letter, with her extreme\r\nreluctance to bring the writer of it and her cousin Edmund together,\r\nwould have made her (as she felt) incapable of judging impartially\r\nwhether the concluding offer might be accepted or not.', 'Happily,\r\nhowever, she was not left to weigh and decide between opposite\r\ninclinations and doubtful notions of right; there was no occasion to\r\ndetermine whether she ought to keep Edmund and Mary asunder or not.', 'Miss\r\nCrawford, herself, Edmund; but it was dangerous, perhaps, to tread such\r\nground.', 'Julia’s, Tom’s, Edmund’s;\r\nthere a yet longer pause.', 'Sir Thomas’s parental solicitude and high sense of honour and\r\ndecorum, Edmund’s upright principles, unsuspicious temper, and genuine\r\nstrength of feeling, made her think it scarcely possible for them to\r\nsupport life and reason under such disgrace; and it appeared to her\r\nthat, as far as this world alone was concerned, the greatest blessing\r\nto every one of kindred with Mrs. Rushworth would be instant\r\nannihilation.', 'It bore the\r\nLondon postmark, and came from Edmund.', 'By eight in the morning Edmund was in the house.', 'She was now left a good deal to herself, to get acquainted with the\r\nhouse and grounds as she could, and spent her days very happily in so\r\ndoing, while those who might otherwise have attended to her were shut\r\nup, or wholly occupied each with the person quite dependent on them, at\r\nthis time, for everything like comfort; Edmund trying to bury his own\r\nfeelings in exertions for the relief of his brother’s, and Fanny\r\ndevoted to her aunt Bertram, returning to every former office with more\r\nthan former zeal, and thinking she could never do enough for one who\r\nseemed so much to want her.', 'Sir Thomas set off, Edmund would go with him, and the others\r\nhad been left in a state of wretchedness, inferior only to what\r\nfollowed the receipt of the next letters from London.', 'His stay must\r\nbe on Edmund alone.', 'She was mistaken, however, in supposing that Edmund gave his father no\r\npresent pain.', 'He was aware of what Edmund must be suffering on his own behalf, in\r\naddition to all the rest, when they were in town: he had seen or\r\nconjectured his feelings; and, having reason to think that one\r\ninterview with Miss Crawford had taken place, from which Edmund derived\r\nonly increased distress, had been as anxious on that account as on\r\nothers to get him out of town, and had engaged him in taking Fanny home\r\nto her aunt, with a view to his relief and benefit, no less than\r\ntheirs.', 'That Edmund must be for ever divided from Miss Crawford did not admit\r\nof a doubt with Fanny; and yet, till she knew that he felt the same,\r\nher own conviction was insufficient.', 'They reached Mansfield on Thursday, and it was not till\r\nSunday evening that Edmund began to talk to her on the subject.', 'Let Sir Thomas\r\ntrust to his honour and compassion, and it may all end well; but if he\r\nget his daughter away, it will be destroying the chief hold.’”\r\n\r\nAfter repeating this, Edmund was so much affected that Fanny, watching\r\nhim with silent, but most tender concern, was almost sorry that the\r\nsubject had been entered on at all.', 'She was returned to Mansfield Park, she was\r\nuseful, she was beloved; she was safe from Mr. Crawford; and when Sir\r\nThomas came back she had every proof that could be given in his then\r\nmelancholy state of spirits, of his perfect approbation and increased\r\nregard; and happy as all this must make her, she would still have been\r\nhappy without any of it, for Edmund was no longer the dupe of Miss\r\nCrawford.', 'It is true that Edmund was very far from happy himself.', 'and quite as soon as Sir Thomas could place\r\ndependence on such sources of good, Edmund was contributing to his\r\nfather’s ease by improvement in the only point in which he had given\r\nhim pain before—improvement in his spirits.', 'They lived together; and when Dr.\r\nGrant had brought on apoplexy and death, by three great institutionary\r\ndinners in one week, they still lived together; for Mary, though\r\nperfectly resolved against ever attaching herself to a younger brother\r\nagain, was long in finding among the dashing representatives, or idle\r\nheir-apparents, who were at the command of her beauty, and her £20,000,\r\nany one who could satisfy the better taste she had acquired at\r\nMansfield, whose character and manners could authorise a hope of the\r\ndomestic happiness she had there learned to estimate, or put Edmund\r\nBertram sufficiently out of her head.', 'I only entreat everybody to believe that\r\nexactly at the time when it was quite natural that it should be so, and\r\nnot a week earlier, Edmund did cease to care about Miss Crawford, and\r\nbecame as anxious to marry Fanny as Fanny herself could desire.']

['MANSFIELD PARK\r\n\r\n(1814)\r\n\r\nBy Jane Austen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout thirty years ago Miss Maria Ward, of Huntingdon, with only seven\r\nthousand pounds, had the good luck to captivate Sir Thomas Bertram, of\r\nMansfield Park, in the county of Northampton, and to be thereby raised\r\nto the rank of a baronet’s lady, with all the comforts and consequences\r\nof an handsome house and large income.', 'Miss Ward’s match, indeed, when it came to the point, was not\r\ncontemptible: Sir Thomas being happily able to give his friend an\r\nincome in the living of Mansfield; and Mr. and Mrs. Norris began their\r\ncareer of conjugal felicity with very little less than a thousand a\r\nyear.', 'Their homes were so distant, and the circles in which they moved so\r\ndistinct, as almost to preclude the means of ever hearing of each\r\nother’s existence during the eleven following years, or, at least, to\r\nmake it very wonderful to Sir Thomas that Mrs. Norris should ever have\r\nit in her power to tell them, as she now and then did, in an angry\r\nvoice, that Fanny had got another child.', 'Was there any chance of his being hereafter\r\nuseful to Sir Thomas in the concerns of his West Indian property?', 'No\r\nsituation would be beneath him; or what did Sir Thomas think of\r\nWoolwich?', '“My dear Sir Thomas, I perfectly comprehend you, and do justice to the\r\ngenerosity and delicacy of your notions, which indeed are quite of a\r\npiece with your general conduct; and I entirely agree with you in the\r\nmain as to the propriety of doing everything one could by way of\r\nproviding for a child one had in a manner taken into one’s own hands;\r\nand I am sure I should be the last person in the world to withhold my\r\nmite upon such an occasion.', 'A niece of\r\nours, Sir Thomas, I may say, or at least of _yours_, would not grow up\r\nin this neighbourhood without many advantages.', 'But breed her up with them from this time, and\r\nsuppose her even to have the beauty of an angel, and she will never be\r\nmore to either than a sister.”\r\n\r\n“There is a great deal of truth in what you say,” replied Sir Thomas,\r\n“and far be it from me to throw any fanciful impediment in the way of a\r\nplan which would be so consistent with the relative situations of each.', 'My dear Sir Thomas, with all my faults I have a warm\r\nheart; and, poor as I am, would rather deny myself the necessaries of\r\nlife than do an ungenerous thing.', 'I\r\ndare say there is always some reputable tradesman’s wife or other going\r\nup.”\r\n\r\nExcept to the attack on Nanny’s cousin, Sir Thomas no longer made any\r\nobjection, and a more respectable, though less economical rendezvous\r\nbeing accordingly substituted, everything was considered as settled,\r\nand the pleasures of so benevolent a scheme were already enjoyed.', 'The\r\ndivision of gratifying sensations ought not, in strict justice, to have\r\nbeen equal; for Sir Thomas was fully resolved to be the real and\r\nconsistent patron of the selected child, and Mrs. Norris had not the\r\nleast intention of being at any expense whatever in her maintenance.', 'When the subject was brought forward again, her views were more fully\r\nexplained; and, in reply to Lady Bertram’s calm inquiry of “Where shall\r\nthe child come to first, sister, to you or to us?” Sir Thomas heard\r\nwith some surprise that it would be totally out of Mrs. Norris’s power\r\nto take any share in the personal charge of her.', 'After a short pause Sir Thomas added with dignity, “Yes, let\r\nher home be in this house.', '“I hope she will prove a well-disposed girl,” continued Mrs. Norris,\r\n“and be sensible of her uncommon good fortune in having such friends.”\r\n\r\n“Should her disposition be really bad,” said Sir Thomas, “we must not,\r\nfor our own children’s sake, continue her in the family; but there is\r\nno reason to expect so great an evil.', 'She was disheartened by Lady\r\nBertram’s silence, awed by Sir Thomas’s grave looks, and quite overcome\r\nby Mrs. Norris’s admonitions.', 'As her appearance and spirits improved, Sir Thomas and Mrs. Norris\r\nthought with greater satisfaction of their benevolent plan; and it was\r\npretty soon decided between them that, though far from clever, she\r\nshowed a tractable disposition, and seemed likely to give them little\r\ntrouble.', 'She was a woman who spent\r\nher days in sitting, nicely dressed, on a sofa, doing some long piece\r\nof needlework, of little use and no beauty, thinking more of her pug\r\nthan her children, but very indulgent to the latter when it did not put\r\nherself to inconvenience, guided in everything important by Sir Thomas,\r\nand in smaller concerns by her sister.', 'From about the time of her entering the family, Lady Bertram, in\r\nconsequence of a little ill-health, and a great deal of indolence, gave\r\nup the house in town, which she had been used to occupy every spring,\r\nand remained wholly in the country, leaving Sir Thomas to attend his\r\nduty in Parliament, with whatever increase or diminution of comfort\r\nmight arise from her absence.', 'Mrs. Norris, on quitting the\r\nParsonage, removed first to the Park, and afterwards to a small house\r\nof Sir Thomas’s in the village, and consoled herself for the loss of\r\nher husband by considering that she could do very well without him; and\r\nfor her reduction of income by the evident necessity of stricter\r\neconomy.', 'There was another family living actually\r\nheld for Edmund; but though this circumstance had made the arrangement\r\nsomewhat easier to Sir Thomas’s conscience, he could not but feel it to\r\nbe an act of injustice, and he earnestly tried to impress his eldest\r\nson with the same conviction, in the hope of its producing a better\r\neffect than anything he had yet been able to say or do.', 'The time was now come when Sir Thomas expected his sister-in-law to\r\nclaim her share in their niece, the change in Mrs. Norris’s situation,\r\nand the improvement in Fanny’s age, seeming not merely to do away any\r\nformer objection to their living together, but even to give it the most\r\ndecided eligibility; and as his own circumstances were rendered less\r\nfair than heretofore, by some recent losses on his West India estate,\r\nin addition to his eldest son’s extravagance, it became not undesirable\r\nto himself to be relieved from the expense of her support, and the\r\nobligation of her future provision.', 'Not all her precautions, however, could save her from\r\nbeing suspected of something better; or, perhaps, her very display of\r\nthe importance of a spare room might have misled Sir Thomas to suppose\r\nit really intended for Fanny.', 'I never spoke a syllable about it to Sir Thomas, nor he to\r\nme.', 'Sure Sir Thomas could not seriously expect such a thing!', 'How came Sir Thomas to speak to you about it?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, I do not know.', 'Sir Thomas will take care of that.”\r\n\r\n“Why, you know, Sir Thomas’s means will be rather straitened if the\r\nAntigua estate is to make such poor returns.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!', 'The necessity of the measure in a pecuniary light, and the hope of its\r\nutility to his son, reconciled Sir Thomas to the effort of quitting the\r\nrest of his family, and of leaving his daughters to the direction of\r\nothers at their present most interesting time of life.', 'They were relieved by it from all\r\nrestraint; and without aiming at one gratification that would probably\r\nhave been forbidden by Sir Thomas, they felt themselves immediately at\r\ntheir own disposal, and to have every indulgence within their reach.', 'The earliest intelligence of the travellers’ safe arrival at Antigua,\r\nafter a favourable voyage, was received; though not before Mrs. Norris\r\nhad been indulging in very dreadful fears, and trying to make Edmund\r\nparticipate them whenever she could get him alone; and as she depended\r\non being the first person made acquainted with any fatal catastrophe,\r\nshe had already arranged the manner of breaking it to all the others,\r\nwhen Sir Thomas’s assurances of their both being alive and well made it\r\nnecessary to lay by her agitation and affectionate preparatory speeches\r\nfor a while.', 'She was\r\nsure Sir Thomas had never intended it: and she must say that, to be\r\nmaking such a purchase in his absence, and adding to the great expenses\r\nof his stable, at a time when a large part of his income was unsettled,\r\nseemed to her very unjustifiable.', 'Lady Bertram did: she entirely agreed with her son as to the necessity\r\nof it, and as to its being considered necessary by his father; she only\r\npleaded against there being any hurry; she only wanted him to wait till\r\nSir Thomas’s return, and then Sir Thomas might settle it all himself.', 'As the horse continued in name, as well as fact, the property of\r\nEdmund, Mrs. Norris could tolerate its being for Fanny’s use; and had\r\nLady Bertram ever thought about her own objection again, he might have\r\nbeen excused in her eyes for not waiting till Sir Thomas’s return in\r\nSeptember, for when September came Sir Thomas was still abroad, and\r\nwithout any near prospect of finishing his business.', '“If poor Sir Thomas were fated never\r\nto return, it would be peculiarly consoling to see their dear Maria\r\nwell married,” she very often thought; always when they were in the\r\ncompany of men of fortune, and particularly on the introduction of a\r\nyoung man who had recently succeeded to one of the largest estates and\r\nfinest places in the country.', 'After dancing with each other at a proper number of balls, the young\r\npeople justified these opinions, and an engagement, with a due\r\nreference to the absent Sir Thomas, was entered into, much to the\r\nsatisfaction of their respective families, and of the general\r\nlookers-on of the neighbourhood, who had, for many weeks past, felt the\r\nexpediency of Mr. Rushworth’s marrying Miss Bertram.', 'It was some months before Sir Thomas’s consent could be received; but,\r\nin the meanwhile, as no one felt a doubt of his most cordial pleasure\r\nin the connexion, the intercourse of the two families was carried on\r\nwithout restraint, and no other attempt made at secrecy than Mrs.\r\nNorris’s talking of it everywhere as a matter not to be talked of at\r\npresent.', 'She looked about her with due\r\nconsideration, and found almost everything in his favour: a park, a\r\nreal park, five miles round, a spacious modern-built house, so well\r\nplaced and well screened as to deserve to be in any collection of\r\nengravings of gentlemen’s seats in the kingdom, and wanting only to be\r\ncompletely new furnished—pleasant sisters, a quiet mother, and an\r\nagreeable man himself—with the advantage of being tied up from much\r\ngaming at present by a promise to his father, and of being Sir Thomas\r\nhereafter.', 'You young ones do not remember much about it, perhaps;\r\nbut if dear Sir Thomas were here, he could tell you what improvements\r\nwe made: and a great deal more would have been done, but for poor Mr.\r\nNorris’s sad state of health.', 'He could hardly ever get out, poor man,\r\nto enjoy anything, and _that_ disheartened me from doing several things\r\nthat Sir Thomas and I used to talk of.', '“The\r\nsoil is good; and I never pass it without regretting that the fruit\r\nshould be so little worth the trouble of gathering.”\r\n\r\n“Sir, it is a Moor Park, we bought it as a Moor Park, and it cost\r\nus—that is, it was a present from Sir Thomas, but I saw the bill—and I\r\nknow it cost seven shillings, and was charged as a Moor Park.”\r\n\r\n“You were imposed on, ma’am,” replied Dr. Grant: “these potatoes have\r\nas much the flavour of a Moor Park apricot as the fruit from that tree.', 'how you did tremble\r\nwhen Sir Thomas first had you put on!”\r\n\r\nIn the drawing-room Miss Crawford was also celebrated.', 'After what passed at first, he would claim it as a promise.”\r\n\r\n“And, my dear Edmund,” added Mrs. Norris, “taking out _two_ carriages\r\nwhen _one_ will do, would be trouble for nothing; and, between\r\nourselves, coachman is not very fond of the roads between this and\r\nSotherton: he always complains bitterly of the narrow lanes scratching\r\nhis carriage, and you know one should not like to have dear Sir Thomas,\r\nwhen he comes home, find all the varnish scratched off.”\r\n\r\n“That would not be a very handsome reason for using Mr. Crawford’s,”\r\nsaid Maria; “but the truth is, that Wilcox is a stupid old fellow, and\r\ndoes not know how to drive.', 'It was very vexatious, and she was heartily sorry for it; but so it\r\nwas; and so far from now meaning to marry the elder, she did not even\r\nwant to attract him beyond what the simplest claims of conscious beauty\r\nrequired: his lengthened absence from Mansfield, without anything but\r\npleasure in view, and his own will to consult, made it perfectly clear\r\nthat he did not care about her; and his indifference was so much more\r\nthan equalled by her own, that were he now to step forth the owner of\r\nMansfield Park, the Sir Thomas complete, which he was to be in time,\r\nshe did not believe she could accept him.', 'I\r\ncannot but think of dear Sir Thomas’s delight.', 'But when my aunt has got a fancy in her\r\nhead, nothing can stop her.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Honourable John Yates, this new friend, had not much to recommend\r\nhim beyond habits of fashion and expense, and being the younger son of\r\na lord with a tolerable independence; and Sir Thomas would probably\r\nhave thought his introduction at Mansfield by no means desirable.', 'Something of a theatre we must\r\nhave undoubtedly, but it will be on the simplest plan: a green curtain\r\nand a little carpenter’s work, and that’s all; and as the carpenter’s\r\nwork may be all done at home by Christopher Jackson himself, it will be\r\ntoo absurd to talk of expense; and as long as Jackson is employed,\r\neverything will be right with Sir Thomas.', 'And would Edmund’s judgment, would his\r\npersuasion of Sir Thomas’s disapprobation of the whole, be enough to\r\njustify her in a determined denial in spite of all the rest?', 'When Sir Thomas comes, I\r\ndare say he will be in for some borough, but there has been nobody to\r\nput him in the way of doing anything yet.”\r\n\r\n“Sir Thomas is to achieve many mighty things when he comes home,” said\r\nMary, after a pause.', 'Edmund, between his theatrical and his real\r\npart, between Miss Crawford’s claims and his own conduct, between love\r\nand consistency, was equally unobservant; and Mrs. Norris was too busy\r\nin contriving and directing the general little matters of the company,\r\nsuperintending their various dresses with economical expedient, for\r\nwhich nobody thanked her, and saving, with delighted integrity, half a\r\ncrown here and there to the absent Sir Thomas, to have leisure for\r\nwatching the behaviour, or guarding the happiness of his daughters.', 'Will not it be right for me to go too?” but they\r\nwere no sooner through the door than Henry Crawford undertook to answer\r\nthe anxious inquiry, and, encouraging him by all means to pay his\r\nrespects to Sir Thomas without delay, sent him after the others with\r\ndelighted haste.', 'She had been\r\nquite overlooked by her cousins; and as her own opinion of her claims\r\non Sir Thomas’s affection was much too humble to give her any idea of\r\nclassing herself with his children, she was glad to remain behind and\r\ngain a little breathing-time.', 'She had found a seat, where in excessive trembling she\r\nwas enduring all these fearful thoughts, while the other three, no\r\nlonger under any restraint, were giving vent to their feelings of\r\nvexation, lamenting over such an unlooked-for premature arrival as a\r\nmost untoward event, and without mercy wishing poor Sir Thomas had been\r\ntwice as long on his passage, or were still in Antigua.', 'The ruin of the play was to them a certainty: they felt the\r\ntotal destruction of the scheme to be inevitably at hand; while Mr.\r\nYates considered it only as a temporary interruption, a disaster for\r\nthe evening, and could even suggest the possibility of the rehearsal\r\nbeing renewed after tea, when the bustle of receiving Sir Thomas were\r\nover, and he might be at leisure to be amused by it.', 'There was nothing\r\ndisagreeable in Mr. Rushworth’s appearance, and Sir Thomas was liking\r\nhim already.', 'Not that _she_ was incommoded by many fears of Sir Thomas’s\r\ndisapprobation when the present state of his house should be known, for\r\nher judgment had been so blinded that, except by the instinctive\r\ncaution with which she had whisked away Mr. Rushworth’s pink satin\r\ncloak as her brother-in-law entered, she could hardly be said to shew\r\nany sign of alarm; but she was vexed by the _manner_ of his return.', 'Instead of being sent for out of the room,\r\nand seeing him first, and having to spread the happy news through the\r\nhouse, Sir Thomas, with a very reasonable dependence, perhaps, on the\r\nnerves of his wife and children, had sought no confidant but the\r\nbutler, and had been following him almost instantaneously into the\r\ndrawing-room.', 'Would Sir Thomas have\r\nconsented to eat, she might have gone to the housekeeper with\r\ntroublesome directions, and insulted the footmen with injunctions of\r\ndespatch; but Sir Thomas resolutely declined all dinner: he would take\r\nnothing, nothing till tea came—he would rather wait for tea.', '“Sure, my dear Sir Thomas, a basin of soup would\r\nbe a much better thing for you than tea.', '“But indeed\r\nI would rather have nothing but tea.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, Lady Bertram, suppose you speak for tea directly; suppose\r\nyou hurry Baddeley a little; he seems behindhand to-night.” She carried\r\nthis point, and Sir Thomas’s narrative proceeded.', 'I hope you will take a day’s sport there yourself, sir,\r\nsoon.”\r\n\r\nFor the present the danger was over, and Fanny’s sick feelings\r\nsubsided; but when tea was soon afterwards brought in, and Sir Thomas,\r\ngetting up, said that he found that he could not be any longer in the\r\nhouse without just looking into his own dear room, every agitation was\r\nreturning.', 'His father’s looks of solemnity and amazement on this his\r\nfirst appearance on any stage, and the gradual metamorphosis of the\r\nimpassioned Baron Wildenheim into the well-bred and easy Mr. Yates,\r\nmaking his bow and apology to Sir Thomas Bertram, was such an\r\nexhibition, such a piece of true acting, as he would not have lost upon\r\nany account.', 'Mr. Yates’s family and connexions were sufficiently known\r\nto him to render his introduction as the “particular friend,” another\r\nof the hundred particular friends of his son, exceedingly unwelcome;\r\nand it needed all the felicity of being again at home, and all the\r\nforbearance it could supply, to save Sir Thomas from anger on finding\r\nhimself thus bewildered in his own house, making part of a ridiculous\r\nexhibition in the midst of theatrical nonsense, and forced in so\r\nuntoward a moment to admit the acquaintance of a young man whom he felt\r\nsure of disapproving, and whose easy indifference and volubility in the\r\ncourse of the first five minutes seemed to mark him the most at home of\r\nthe two.', 'A few minutes were enough for such unsatisfactory sensations\r\non each side; and Sir Thomas having exerted himself so far as to speak\r\na few words of calm approbation in reply to an eager appeal of Mr.\r\nYates, as to the happiness of the arrangement, the three gentlemen\r\nreturned to the drawing-room together, Sir Thomas with an increase of\r\ngravity which was not lost on all.', 'It appears a neat job, however, as far as I could judge by\r\ncandlelight, and does my friend Christopher Jackson credit.” And then\r\nhe would have changed the subject, and sipped his coffee in peace over\r\ndomestic matters of a calmer hue; but Mr. Yates, without discernment to\r\ncatch Sir Thomas’s meaning, or diffidence, or delicacy, or discretion\r\nenough to allow him to lead the discourse while he mingled among the\r\nothers with the least obtrusiveness himself, would keep him on the\r\ntopic of the theatre, would torment him with questions and remarks\r\nrelative to it, and finally would make him hear the whole history of\r\nhis disappointment at Ecclesford.', 'It was like treading old ground again.”\r\n\r\nMr. Yates took the subject from his friend as soon as possible, and\r\nimmediately gave Sir Thomas an account of what they had done and were\r\ndoing: told him of the gradual increase of their views, the happy\r\nconclusion of their first difficulties, and present promising state of\r\naffairs; relating everything with so blind an interest as made him not\r\nonly totally unconscious of the uneasy movements of many of his friends\r\nas they sat, the change of countenance, the fidget, the hem!', 'of\r\nunquietness, but prevented him even from seeing the expression of the\r\nface on which his own eyes were fixed—from seeing Sir Thomas’s dark\r\nbrow contract as he looked with inquiring earnestness at his daughters\r\nand Edmund, dwelling particularly on the latter, and speaking a\r\nlanguage, a remonstrance, a reproof, which _he_ felt at his heart.', '“To own the truth, Sir Thomas, we were in\r\nthe middle of a rehearsal when you arrived this evening.', 'We bespeak your indulgence, you understand, as young\r\nperformers; we bespeak your indulgence.”\r\n\r\n“My indulgence shall be given, sir,” replied Sir Thomas gravely, “but\r\nwithout any other rehearsal.” And with a relenting smile, he added, “I\r\ncome home to be happy and indulgent.” Then turning away towards any or\r\nall of the rest, he tranquilly said, “Mr.', 'Mrs. Norris was a little confounded and as\r\nnearly being silenced as ever she had been in her life; for she was\r\nashamed to confess having never seen any of the impropriety which was\r\nso glaring to Sir Thomas, and would not have admitted that her\r\ninfluence was insufficient—that she might have talked in vain.', 'Her only\r\nresource was to get out of the subject as fast as possible, and turn\r\nthe current of Sir Thomas’s ideas into a happier channel.', 'You know the distance to Sotherton; it was in the middle\r\nof winter, and the roads almost impassable, but I did persuade her.”\r\n\r\n“I know how great, how justly great, your influence is with Lady\r\nBertram and her children, and am the more concerned that it should not\r\nhave been—”\r\n\r\n“My dear Sir Thomas, if you had seen the state of the roads _that_ day!', '‘Upon my\r\nword, Mrs. Norris,’ said Mrs. Grant the other day, ‘if Mr. Rushworth\r\nwere a son of your own, he could not hold Sir Thomas in greater\r\nrespect.’”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas gave up the point, foiled by her evasions, disarmed by her\r\nflattery; and was obliged to rest satisfied with the conviction that\r\nwhere the present pleasure of those she loved was at stake, her\r\nkindness did sometimes overpower her judgment.', 'The scene-painter was gone, having spoilt only the floor of one room,\r\nruined all the coachman’s sponges, and made five of the under-servants\r\nidle and dissatisfied; and Sir Thomas was in hopes that another day or\r\ntwo would suffice to wipe away every outward memento of what had been,\r\neven to the destruction of every unbound copy of Lovers’ Vows in the\r\nhouse, for he was burning all that met his eye.', 'Mr. Yates was beginning now to understand Sir Thomas’s intentions,\r\nthough as far as ever from understanding their source.', 'He had known many disagreeable fathers before, and\r\noften been struck with the inconveniences they occasioned, but never,\r\nin the whole course of his life, had he seen one of that class so\r\nunintelligibly moral, so infamously tyrannical as Sir Thomas.', 'The evening passed with external smoothness, though almost every mind\r\nwas ruffled; and the music which Sir Thomas called for from his\r\ndaughters helped to conceal the want of real harmony.', 'Henry Crawford was again in the\r\nhouse: he walked up with Dr. Grant, who was anxious to pay his respects\r\nto Sir Thomas, and at rather an early hour they were ushered into the\r\nbreakfast-room, where were most of the family.', 'Her sensations were indefinable, and\r\nso were they a few minutes afterwards upon hearing Henry Crawford, who\r\nhad a chair between herself and Tom, ask the latter in an undervoice\r\nwhether there were any plans for resuming the play after the present\r\nhappy interruption (with a courteous glance at Sir Thomas), because, in\r\nthat case, he should make a point of returning to Mansfield at any time\r\nrequired by the party: he was going away immediately, being to meet his\r\nuncle at Bath without delay; but if there were any prospect of a\r\nrenewal of Lovers’ Vows, he should hold himself positively engaged, he\r\nshould break through every other claim, he should absolutely condition\r\nwith his uncle for attending them whenever he might be wanted.', 'Mr. Yates had\r\nstaid to see the destruction of every theatrical preparation at\r\nMansfield, the removal of everything appertaining to the play: he left\r\nthe house in all the soberness of its general character; and Sir Thomas\r\nhoped, in seeing him out of it, to be rid of the worst object connected\r\nwith the scheme, and the last that must be inevitably reminding him of\r\nits existence.', 'I should dread the\r\nstupidity of the day, if there were not a much greater evil to\r\nfollow—the impression it must leave on Sir Thomas.', 'I am sorry for them all, and would give\r\nsomething that Rushworth and Maria had never met.”\r\n\r\nIn this quarter, indeed, disappointment was impending over Sir Thomas.', 'With solemn kindness Sir Thomas addressed her: told her his fears,\r\ninquired into her wishes, entreated her to be open and sincere, and\r\nassured her that every inconvenience should be braved, and the\r\nconnexion entirely given up, if she felt herself unhappy in the\r\nprospect of it.', 'Such and such-like were the reasonings of Sir Thomas, happy\r\nto escape the embarrassing evils of a rupture, the wonder, the\r\nreflections, the reproach that must attend it; happy to secure a\r\nmarriage which would bring him such an addition of respectability and\r\ninfluence, and very happy to think anything of his daughter’s\r\ndisposition that was most favourable for the purpose.', 'Had Sir Thomas applied to his daughter within the first three or four\r\ndays after Henry Crawford’s leaving Mansfield, before her feelings were\r\nat all tranquillised, before she had given up every hope of him, or\r\nabsolutely resolved on enduring his rival, her answer might have been\r\ndifferent; but after another three or four days, when there was no\r\nreturn, no letter, no message, no symptom of a softened heart, no hope\r\nof advantage from separation, her mind became cool enough to seek all\r\nthe comfort that pride and self revenge could give.', 'I will ask Sir Thomas, as\r\nsoon as he comes in, whether I can do without her.”\r\n\r\n“As you please, ma’am, on that head; but I meant my father’s opinion as\r\nto the _propriety_ of the invitation’s being accepted or not; and I\r\nthink he will consider it a right thing by Mrs. Grant, as well as by\r\nFanny, that being the _first_ invitation it should be accepted.”\r\n\r\n“I do not know.', 'But he will be very much surprised\r\nthat Mrs. Grant should ask Fanny at all.”\r\n\r\nThere was nothing more to be said, or that could be said to any\r\npurpose, till Sir Thomas were present; but the subject involving, as it\r\ndid, her own evening’s comfort for the morrow, was so much uppermost in\r\nLady Bertram’s mind, that half an hour afterwards, on his looking in\r\nfor a minute in his way from his plantation to his dressing-room, she\r\ncalled him back again, when he had almost closed the door, with “Sir\r\nThomas, stop a moment—I have something to say to you.”\r\n\r\nHer tone of calm languor, for she never took the trouble of raising her\r\nvoice, was always heard and attended to; and Sir Thomas came back.', 'Mrs. Grant has asked Fanny to dinner.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Sir Thomas, as if waiting more to accomplish the surprise.', 'But how can I spare her?”\r\n\r\n“She will be late,” said Sir Thomas, taking out his watch; “but what is\r\nyour difficulty?”\r\n\r\nEdmund found himself obliged to speak and fill up the blanks in his\r\nmother’s story.', 'for Mrs. Grant never used to ask her.”\r\n\r\n“But is it not very natural,” observed Edmund, “that Mrs. Grant should\r\nwish to procure so agreeable a visitor for her sister?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing can be more natural,” said Sir Thomas, after a short\r\ndeliberation; “nor, were there no sister in the case, could anything,\r\nin my opinion, be more natural.', 'But as I conclude that she\r\nmust wish to go, since all young people like to be together, I can see\r\nno reason why she should be denied the indulgence.”\r\n\r\n“But can I do without her, Sir Thomas?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed I think you may.”\r\n\r\n“She always makes tea, you know, when my sister is not here.”\r\n\r\n“Your sister, perhaps, may be prevailed on to spend the day with us,\r\nand I shall certainly be at home.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, then, Fanny may go, Edmund.”\r\n\r\nThe good news soon followed her.', 'She had neither sympathy nor\r\nassistance from those who ought to have entered into her feelings and\r\ndirected her taste; for Lady Bertram never thought of being useful to\r\nanybody, and Mrs. Norris, when she came on the morrow, in consequence\r\nof an early call and invitation from Sir Thomas, was in a very ill\r\nhumour, and seemed intent only on lessening her niece’s pleasure, both\r\npresent and future, as much as possible.', 'She rated her own claims to\r\ncomfort as low even as Mrs. Norris could; and when Sir Thomas soon\r\nafterwards, just opening the door, said, “Fanny, at what time would you\r\nhave the carriage come round?” she felt a degree of astonishment which\r\nmade it impossible for her to speak.', '“My dear Sir Thomas!” cried Mrs. Norris, red with anger, “Fanny can\r\nwalk.”\r\n\r\n“Walk!” repeated Sir Thomas, in a tone of most unanswerable dignity,\r\nand coming farther into the room.', 'The coachman drove round to a minute; another minute brought down the\r\ngentleman; and as the lady had, with a most scrupulous fear of being\r\nlate, been many minutes seated in the drawing-room, Sir Thomas saw them\r\noff in as good time as his own correctly punctual habits required.', 'This was\r\nexactly what Sir Thomas and Edmund had been separately conniving at, as\r\neach proved to the other by the sympathetic alacrity with which they\r\nboth advised Mrs. Norris’s continuing where she was, instead of rushing\r\nout into the hall as soon as the noises of the arrival reached them.', 'William and Fanny soon shewed themselves; and Sir Thomas had the\r\npleasure of receiving, in his protégé, certainly a very different\r\nperson from the one he had equipped seven years ago, but a young man of\r\nan open, pleasant countenance, and frank, unstudied, but feeling and\r\nrespectful manners, and such as confirmed him his friend.', 'His recitals\r\nwere amusing in themselves to Sir Thomas, but the chief object in\r\nseeking them was to understand the reciter, to know the young man by\r\nhis histories; and he listened to his clear, simple, spirited details\r\nwith full satisfaction, seeing in them the proof of good principles,\r\nprofessional knowledge, energy, courage, and cheerfulness, everything\r\nthat could deserve or promise well.', 'With spirits, courage, and\r\ncuriosity up to anything, William expressed an inclination to hunt; and\r\nCrawford could mount him without the slightest inconvenience to\r\nhimself, and with only some scruples to obviate in Sir Thomas, who knew\r\nbetter than his nephew the value of such a loan, and some alarms to\r\nreason away in Fanny.', 'The return of Henry\r\nCrawford, and the arrival of William Price, had much to do with it, but\r\nmuch was still owing to Sir Thomas’s more than toleration of the\r\nneighbourly attempts at the Parsonage.', 'His readiness, however, in agreeing to dine at the Parsonage, when the\r\ngeneral invitation was at last hazarded, after many debates and many\r\ndoubts as to whether it were worth while, “because Sir Thomas seemed so\r\nill inclined, and Lady Bertram was so indolent!” proceeded from\r\ngood-breeding and goodwill alone, and had nothing to do with Mr.\r\nCrawford, but as being one in an agreeable group: for it was in the\r\ncourse of that very visit that he first began to think that any one in\r\nthe habit of such idle observations _would_ _have_ _thought_ that Mr.\r\nCrawford was the admirer of Fanny Price.', 'Luckily Sir Thomas was at hand.', '“What shall I do, Sir Thomas?', 'I know nothing about it, but Fanny must teach\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nHere Fanny interposed, however, with anxious protestations of her own\r\nequal ignorance; she had never played the game nor seen it played in\r\nher life; and Lady Bertram felt a moment’s indecision again; but upon\r\neverybody’s assuring her that nothing could be so easy, that it was the\r\neasiest game on the cards, and Henry Crawford’s stepping forward with a\r\nmost earnest request to be allowed to sit between her ladyship and Miss\r\nPrice, and teach them both, it was so settled; and Sir Thomas, Mrs.\r\nNorris, and Dr. and Mrs. Grant being seated at the table of prime\r\nintellectual state and dignity, the remaining six, under Miss\r\nCrawford’s direction, were arranged round the other.', 'Twice had Sir Thomas inquired into the enjoyment and success of his\r\nlady, but in vain; no pause was long enough for the time his measured\r\nmanner needed; and very little of her state could be known till Mrs.\r\nGrant was able, at the end of the first rubber, to go to her and pay\r\nher compliments.', 'Do not think of me as I appeared then.”\r\n\r\nSotherton was a word to catch Mrs. Norris, and being just then in the\r\nhappy leisure which followed securing the odd trick by Sir Thomas’s\r\ncapital play and her own against Dr. and Mrs. Grant’s great hands, she\r\ncalled out, in high good-humour, “Sotherton!', 'I do not exactly\r\nknow the distance, but when you get back to Portsmouth, if it is not\r\nvery far off, you ought to go over and pay your respects to them; and I\r\ncould send a little parcel by you that I want to get conveyed to your\r\ncousins.”\r\n\r\n“I should be very happy, aunt; but Brighton is almost by Beachey Head;\r\nand if I could get so far, I could not expect to be welcome in such a\r\nsmart place as that—poor scrubby midshipman as I am.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris was beginning an eager assurance of the affability he might\r\ndepend on, when she was stopped by Sir Thomas’s saying with authority,\r\n“I do not advise your going to Brighton, William, as I trust you may\r\nsoon have more convenient opportunities of meeting; but my daughters\r\nwould be happy to see their cousins anywhere; and you will find Mr.\r\nRushworth most sincerely disposed to regard all the connexions of our\r\nfamily as his own.”\r\n\r\n“I would rather find him private secretary to the First Lord than\r\nanything else,” was William’s only answer, in an undervoice, not meant\r\nto reach far, and the subject dropped.', 'As yet Sir Thomas had seen nothing to remark in Mr. Crawford’s\r\nbehaviour; but when the whist-table broke up at the end of the second\r\nrubber, and leaving Dr. Grant and Mrs. Norris to dispute over their\r\nlast play, he became a looker-on at the other, he found his niece the\r\nobject of attentions, or rather of professions, of a somewhat pointed\r\ncharacter.', 'Finding by whom\r\nhe was observed, Henry Crawford addressed himself on the same subject\r\nto Sir Thomas, in a more everyday tone, but still with feeling.', '“I want to be your neighbour, Sir Thomas, as you have, perhaps, heard\r\nme telling Miss Price.', 'Consider the house as\r\nhalf your own every winter, and we will add to the stables on your own\r\nimproved plan, and with all the improvements of your improved plan that\r\nmay occur to you this spring.”\r\n\r\n“We shall be the losers,” continued Sir Thomas.', '“I repeat again,” added Sir Thomas, “that Thornton Lacey is the only\r\nhouse in the neighbourhood in which I should _not_ be happy to wait on\r\nMr. Crawford as occupier.”\r\n\r\nMr. Crawford bowed his thanks.', 'We must hope his son may prove that _he_ knows it too.”\r\n\r\nWhatever effect Sir Thomas’s little harangue might really produce on\r\nMr. Crawford, it raised some awkward sensations in two of the others,\r\ntwo of his most attentive listeners—Miss Crawford and Fanny.', 'He passed, however, for an admirer of her dancing; and Sir Thomas, by\r\nno means displeased, prolonged the conversation on dancing in general,\r\nand was so well engaged in describing the balls of Antigua, and\r\nlistening to what his nephew could relate of the different modes of\r\ndancing which had fallen within his observation, that he had not heard\r\nhis carriage announced, and was first called to the knowledge of it by\r\nthe bustle of Mrs. Norris.', 'The hope of an opportunity, which Sir Thomas\r\nhad then given, was not given to be thought of no more.', 'A dance at home would\r\nbe more eligible; and if—”\r\n\r\n“Ah, my dear Sir Thomas!” interrupted Mrs. Norris, “I knew what was\r\ncoming.', 'Thank your uncle,\r\nWilliam, thank your uncle!”\r\n\r\n“My daughters,” replied Sir Thomas, gravely interposing, “have their\r\npleasures at Brighton, and I hope are very happy; but the dance which I\r\nthink of giving at Mansfield will be for their cousins.', 'Edmund, William, and Fanny did, in their different ways, look and speak\r\nas much grateful pleasure in the promised ball as Sir Thomas could\r\ndesire.', 'She had some extra\r\nvisits from the housekeeper, and her maid was rather hurried in making\r\nup a new dress for her: Sir Thomas gave orders, and Mrs. Norris ran\r\nabout; but all this gave _her_ no trouble, and as she had foreseen,\r\n“there was, in fact, no trouble in the business.”\r\n\r\nEdmund was at this time particularly full of cares: his mind being\r\ndeeply occupied in the consideration of two important events now at\r\nhand, which were to fix his fate in life—ordination and\r\nmatrimony—events of such a serious character as to make the ball, which\r\nwould be very quickly followed by one of them, appear of less moment in\r\nhis eyes than in those of any other person in the house.', 'Only\r\nthink, my dear Sir Thomas, what extraordinary advantages you and I have\r\nbeen the means of giving her.', 'In a few minutes Sir Thomas came to her, and asked if she were engaged;\r\nand the “Yes, sir; to Mr. Crawford,” was exactly what he had intended\r\nto hear.', 'Mr. Crawford was not far off; Sir Thomas brought him to her,\r\nsaying something which discovered to Fanny, that _she_ was to lead the\r\nway and open the ball; an idea that had never occurred to her before.', 'To be urging her opinion against Sir\r\nThomas’s was a proof of the extremity of the case; but such was her\r\nhorror at the first suggestion, that she could actually look him in the\r\nface and say that she hoped it might be settled otherwise; in vain,\r\nhowever: Sir Thomas smiled, tried to encourage her, and then looked too\r\nserious, and said too decidedly, “It must be so, my dear,” for her to\r\nhazard another word; and she found herself the next moment conducted by\r\nMr. Crawford to the top of the room, and standing there to be joined by\r\nthe rest of the dancers, couple after couple, as they were formed.', 'Miss Crawford saw much of Sir Thomas’s thoughts as he stood, and\r\nhaving, in spite of all his wrongs towards her, a general prevailing\r\ndesire of recommending herself to him, took an opportunity of stepping\r\naside to say something agreeable of Fanny.', 'ma’am, how much we want dear Mrs. Rushworth and Julia to-night!” and\r\nMrs. Norris paid her with as many smiles and courteous words as she had\r\ntime for, amid so much occupation as she found for herself in making up\r\ncard-tables, giving hints to Sir Thomas, and trying to move all the\r\nchaperons to a better part of the room.', 'A weariness, arising probably, in great measure,\r\nfrom the same feelings which he had acknowledged in the morning, was\r\npeculiarly to be respected, and they went down their two dances\r\ntogether with such sober tranquillity as might satisfy any looker-on\r\nthat Sir Thomas had been bringing up no wife for his younger son.', 'When her two dances with him were over, her inclination and strength\r\nfor more were pretty well at an end; and Sir Thomas, having seen her\r\nwalk rather than dance down the shortening set, breathless, and with\r\nher hand at her side, gave his orders for her sitting down entirely.', 'my good friend,” said Sir Thomas, producing his watch with\r\nall necessary caution; “it is three o’clock, and your sister is not\r\nused to these sort of hours.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, Fanny, you shall not get up to-morrow before I go.', 'Your brother will find my ideas of\r\ntime and his own very different to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nAfter a short consideration, Sir Thomas asked Crawford to join the\r\nearly breakfast party in that house instead of eating alone: he should\r\nhimself be of it; and the readiness with which his invitation was\r\naccepted convinced him that the suspicions whence, he must confess to\r\nhimself, this very ball had in great measure sprung, were well founded.', 'Shortly afterward, Sir Thomas was again interfering a little with her\r\ninclination, by advising her to go immediately to bed.', 'In thus sending her away, Sir Thomas perhaps might not be thinking\r\nmerely of her health.', '“She could not recollect what it\r\nwas that she had heard about one of the Miss Maddoxes, or what it was\r\nthat Lady Prescott had noticed in Fanny: she was not sure whether\r\nColonel Harrison had been talking of Mr. Crawford or of William when he\r\nsaid he was the finest young man in the room—somebody had whispered\r\nsomething to her; she had forgot to ask Sir Thomas what it could be.”\r\nAnd these were her longest speeches and clearest communications: the\r\nrest was only a languid “Yes, yes; very well; did you?', 'Fetch the cards; I feel\r\nso very stupid.”\r\n\r\nThe cards were brought, and Fanny played at cribbage with her aunt till\r\nbedtime; and as Sir Thomas was reading to himself, no sounds were heard\r\nin the room for the next two hours beyond the reckonings of the\r\ngame—“And _that_ makes thirty-one; four in hand and eight in crib.', '“We miss our two young men,” was Sir Thomas’s observation on both the\r\nfirst and second day, as they formed their very reduced circle after\r\ndinner; and in consideration of Fanny’s swimming eyes, nothing more was\r\nsaid on the first day than to drink their good health; but on the\r\nsecond it led to something farther.', 'I wish they would stay at home.”\r\n\r\nThis wish was levelled principally at Julia, who had just applied for\r\npermission to go to town with Maria; and as Sir Thomas thought it best\r\nfor each daughter that the permission should be granted, Lady Bertram,\r\nthough in her own good-nature she would not have prevented it, was\r\nlamenting the change it made in the prospect of Julia’s return, which\r\nwould otherwise have taken place about this time.', 'A great deal of good\r\nsense followed on Sir Thomas’s side, tending to reconcile his wife to\r\nthe arrangement.', 'If we have been kind to\r\n_her_, she is now quite as necessary to _us_.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Lady Bertram presently; “and it is a comfort to think that\r\nwe shall always have _her_.”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas paused, half smiled, glanced at his niece, and then gravely\r\nreplied, “She will never leave us, I hope, till invited to some other\r\nhome that may reasonably promise her greater happiness than she knows\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\n“And _that_ is not very likely to be, Sir Thomas.', 'Who could write chat to Sir Thomas?', 'She is niece to Sir Thomas Bertram; that will be enough for the world.', 'True, I believe he is, generally speaking, kind to her, and so\r\nis Sir Thomas in his way; but it is the way of a rich, superior,\r\nlong-worded, arbitrary uncle.', 'What can Sir Thomas and Edmund together\r\ndo, what _do_ they do for her happiness, comfort, honour, and dignity\r\nin the world, to what I _shall_ do?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry Crawford was at Mansfield Park again the next morning, and at an\r\nearlier hour than common visiting warrants.', 'She was almost at\r\nthe door, and not chusing by any means to take so much trouble in vain,\r\nshe still went on, after a civil reception, a short sentence about\r\nbeing waited for, and a “Let Sir Thomas know” to the servant.', 'I know it is all nothing.”\r\n\r\nShe had burst away from him, and at that moment Sir Thomas was heard\r\nspeaking to a servant in his way towards the room they were in.', 'She rushed out at an opposite door from the one her uncle\r\nwas approaching, and was walking up and down the East room in the\r\nutmost confusion of contrary feeling, before Sir Thomas’s politeness or\r\napologies were over, or he had reached the beginning of the joyful\r\nintelligence which his visitor came to communicate.', 'Now, here are\r\nmy sister Price’s children; take them all together, I dare say nobody\r\nwould believe what a sum they cost Sir Thomas every year, to say\r\nnothing of what _I_ do for them.”\r\n\r\n“Very true, sister, as you say.', 'they cannot help it;\r\nand you know it makes very little difference to Sir Thomas.', 'She had quite convinced herself of this before Sir Thomas\r\nand Mr. Crawford joined them.', 'It was indeed Sir Thomas\r\nwho opened the door and asked if she were there, and if he might come\r\nin.', 'After a moment’s\r\npause, Sir Thomas, trying to suppress a smile, went on.', 'Mr. Crawford’s business had been to declare himself the lover of Fanny,\r\nmake decided proposals for her, and entreat the sanction of the uncle,\r\nwho seemed to stand in the place of her parents; and he had done it all\r\nso well, so openly, so liberally, so properly, that Sir Thomas,\r\nfeeling, moreover, his own replies, and his own remarks to have been\r\nvery much to the purpose, was exceedingly happy to give the particulars\r\nof their conversation; and little aware of what was passing in his\r\nniece’s mind, conceived that by such details he must be gratifying her\r\nfar more than himself.', 'He is in\r\nmy room, and hoping to see you there.”\r\n\r\nThere was a look, a start, an exclamation on hearing this, which\r\nastonished Sir Thomas; but what was his increase of astonishment on\r\nhearing her exclaim—“Oh!', 'Mr. Crawford ought to know—he must know that: I told him enough\r\nyesterday to convince him; he spoke to me on this subject yesterday,\r\nand I told him without disguise that it was very disagreeable to me,\r\nand quite out of my power to return his good opinion.”\r\n\r\n“I do not catch your meaning,” said Sir Thomas, sitting down again.', '“Am I to understand,” said Sir Thomas, after a few moments’ silence,\r\n“that you mean to _refuse_ Mr. Crawford?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Refuse him?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Refuse Mr. Crawford!', 'For what reason?”\r\n\r\n“I—I cannot like him, sir, well enough to marry him.”\r\n\r\n“This is very strange!” said Sir Thomas, in a voice of calm\r\ndispleasure.', '“You must have been aware,” continued Sir Thomas presently, “you must\r\nhave been some time aware of a particularity in Mr. Crawford’s manners\r\nto you.', '“Independently of the interest which Mr. Crawford’s _choice_ seemed to\r\njustify” said Sir Thomas, beginning again, and very composedly, “his\r\nwishing to marry at all so early is recommendatory to me.', 'Do you agree with me, my dear?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\nIt was gently, but it was calmly said, and Sir Thomas was easy on the\r\nscore of the cousins.', 'If the gentleman would but persevere, if he had but love\r\nenough to persevere, Sir Thomas began to have hopes; and these\r\nreflections having passed across his mind and cheered it, “Well,” said\r\nhe, in a tone of becoming gravity, but of less anger, “well, child, dry\r\nup your tears.', 'I am totally unequal to it.”\r\n\r\nBut Fanny shewed such reluctance, such misery, at the idea of going\r\ndown to him, that Sir Thomas, after a little consideration, judged it\r\nbetter to indulge her.', 'She wondered that Sir Thomas could have leisure to think of\r\nsuch a trifle again; but she soon found, from the voluntary information\r\nof the housemaid, who came in to attend it, that so it was to be every\r\nday.', '“Oh!” said Mrs. Norris, with a moment’s check, “that was very kind of\r\nyou, Sir Thomas; but you do not know how dry the path is to my house.', 'If she would but have let us know she was going out but there is\r\na something about Fanny, I have often observed it before—she likes to\r\ngo her own way to work; she does not like to be dictated to; she takes\r\nher own independent walk whenever she can; she certainly has a little\r\nspirit of secrecy, and independence, and nonsense, about her, which I\r\nwould advise her to get the better of.”\r\n\r\nAs a general reflection on Fanny, Sir Thomas thought nothing could be\r\nmore unjust, though he had been so lately expressing the same\r\nsentiments himself, and he tried to turn the conversation: tried\r\nrepeatedly before he could succeed; for Mrs. Norris had not discernment\r\nenough to perceive, either now, or at any other time, to what degree he\r\nthought well of his niece, or how very far he was from wishing to have\r\nhis own children’s merits set off by the depreciation of hers.', 'What should Sir Thomas want you for?', 'He had all the\r\ndisposition to persevere that Sir Thomas could wish him.', 'Satisfied that the cause was now on a footing the most proper and\r\nhopeful, Sir Thomas resolved to abstain from all farther importunity\r\nwith his niece, and to shew no open interference.', 'Had his choice been less unexceptionable, I should\r\nhave condemned his persevering.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, sir,” said Fanny, “I am very sorry that Mr. Crawford should\r\ncontinue to—I know that it is paying me a very great compliment, and I\r\nfeel most undeservedly honoured; but I am so perfectly convinced, and I\r\nhave told him so, that it never will be in my power—”\r\n\r\n“My dear,” interrupted Sir Thomas, “there is no occasion for this.', 'In spite of his intended silence, Sir Thomas found himself once more\r\nobliged to mention the subject to his niece, to prepare her briefly for\r\nits being imparted to her aunts; a measure which he would still have\r\navoided, if possible, but which became necessary from the totally\r\nopposite feelings of Mr. Crawford as to any secrecy of proceeding.', 'When Sir Thomas understood this, he felt the necessity\r\nof making his own wife and sister-in-law acquainted with the business\r\nwithout delay; though, on Fanny’s account, he almost dreaded the effect\r\nof the communication to Mrs. Norris as much as Fanny herself.', 'I must just speak of it _once_, I told Sir Thomas I must\r\n_once_, and then I shall have done.', 'I shall tell Sir Thomas that I am sure it was done that\r\nevening.” And still pursuing the same cheerful thoughts, she soon\r\nafterwards added, “And I will tell you what, Fanny, which is more than\r\nI did for Maria: the next time Pug has a litter you shall have a\r\npuppy.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nEdmund had great things to hear on his return.', 'His surprise was not so great as his father’s at\r\nher refusing Crawford, because, so far from supposing her to consider\r\nhim with anything like a preference, he had always believed it to be\r\nrather the reverse, and could imagine her to be taken perfectly\r\nunprepared, but Sir Thomas could not regard the connexion as more\r\ndesirable than he did.', 'It had every recommendation to him; and while\r\nhonouring her for what she had done under the influence of her present\r\nindifference, honouring her in rather stronger terms than Sir Thomas\r\ncould quite echo, he was most earnest in hoping, and sanguine in\r\nbelieving, that it would be a match at last, and that, united by mutual\r\naffection, it would appear that their dispositions were as exactly\r\nfitted to make them blessed in each other, as he was now beginning\r\nseriously to consider them.', '“I wish Sir Thomas had been\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\nCrawford was excessively pleased.', 'A day, and a very early day, was actually fixed for the Crawfords’\r\ndeparture; and Sir Thomas thought it might be as well to make one more\r\neffort for the young man before he left Mansfield, that all his\r\nprofessions and vows of unshaken attachment might have as much hope to\r\nsustain them as possible.', '“I will speak to her, sir: I will take the first opportunity of\r\nspeaking to her alone,” was the result of such thoughts as these; and\r\nupon Sir Thomas’s information of her being at that very time walking\r\nalone in the shrubbery, he instantly joined her.', 'Poor Sir Thomas, who was glad to see you?', 'Yet, Fanny,\r\ndo not imagine I would now speak disrespectfully of Sir Thomas, though\r\nI certainly did hate him for many a week.', 'My own sister as\r\na wife, Sir Thomas Bertram as a husband, are my standards of\r\nperfection.', '“I shall see your cousin in town soon: he talks of being there\r\ntolerably soon; and Sir Thomas, I dare say, in the course of the\r\nspring; and your eldest cousin, and the Rushworths, and Julia, I am\r\nsure of meeting again and again, and all but you.', 'CHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Crawford gone, Sir Thomas’s next object was that he should be\r\nmissed; and he entertained great hope that his niece would find a blank\r\nin the loss of those attentions which at the time she had felt, or\r\nfancied, an evil.', 'It had\r\noccurred to Sir Thomas, in one of his dignified musings, as a right and\r\ndesirable measure; but before he absolutely made up his mind, he\r\nconsulted his son.', 'This was enough to determine Sir Thomas; and a decisive “then so\r\nit shall be” closed that stage of the business; Sir Thomas retiring\r\nfrom it with some feelings of satisfaction, and views of good over and\r\nabove what he had communicated to his son; for his prime motive in\r\nsending her away had very little to do with the propriety of her seeing\r\nher parents again, and nothing at all with any idea of making her\r\nhappy.', 'She was of use to no one else; but _there_ she might be\r\nmissed to a degree that she did not like to think of; and that part of\r\nthe arrangement was, indeed, the hardest for Sir Thomas to accomplish,\r\nand what only _he_ could have accomplished at all.', 'When he had really resolved on any\r\nmeasure, he could always carry it through; and now by dint of long\r\ntalking on the subject, explaining and dwelling on the duty of Fanny’s\r\nsometimes seeing her family, he did induce his wife to let her go;\r\nobtaining it rather from submission, however, than conviction, for Lady\r\nBertram was convinced of very little more than that Sir Thomas thought\r\nFanny ought to go, and therefore that she must.', 'Mrs. Norris was left to settle the matter by herself; and it\r\nended, to the infinite joy of her nephew and niece, in the recollection\r\nthat she could not possibly be spared from Mansfield Park at present;\r\nthat she was a great deal too necessary to Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram\r\nfor her to be able to answer it to herself to leave them even for a\r\nweek, and therefore must certainly sacrifice every other pleasure to\r\nthat of being useful to them.', 'CHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe novelty of travelling, and the happiness of being with William,\r\nsoon produced their natural effect on Fanny’s spirits, when Mansfield\r\nPark was fairly left behind; and by the time their first stage was\r\nended, and they were to quit Sir Thomas’s carriage, she was able to\r\ntake leave of the old coachman, and send back proper messages, with\r\ncheerful looks.', 'CHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nCould Sir Thomas have seen all his niece’s feelings, when she wrote her\r\nfirst letter to her aunt, he would not have despaired; for though a\r\ngood night’s rest, a pleasant morning, the hope of soon seeing William\r\nagain, and the comparatively quiet state of the house, from Tom and\r\nCharles being gone to school, Sam on some project of his own, and her\r\nfather on his usual lounges, enabled her to express herself cheerfully\r\non the subject of home, there were still, to her own perfect\r\nconsciousness, many drawbacks suppressed.', 'I am aware\r\nthat you may be left here week after week, if Sir Thomas cannot settle\r\neverything for coming himself, or sending your aunt’s maid for you,\r\nwithout involving the slightest alteration of the arrangements which he\r\nmay have laid down for the next quarter of a year.', 'After being nursed up at Mansfield, it was too late in the day to\r\nbe hardened at Portsmouth; and though Sir Thomas, had he known all,\r\nmight have thought his niece in the most promising way of being\r\nstarved, both mind and body, into a much juster value for Mr.\r\nCrawford’s good company and good fortune, he would probably have feared\r\nto push his experiment farther, lest she might die under the cure.', 'And my poor aunt talking of me every hour!”\r\n\r\nFanny checked the tendency of these thoughts as well as she could, but\r\nshe was within half a minute of starting the idea that Sir Thomas was\r\nquite unkind, both to her aunt and to herself.', 'For though Lady Bertram\r\nrather shone in the epistolary line, having early in her marriage, from\r\nthe want of other employment, and the circumstance of Sir Thomas’s\r\nbeing in Parliament, got into the way of making and keeping\r\ncorrespondents, and formed for herself a very creditable, common-place,\r\namplifying style, so that a very little matter was enough for her: she\r\ncould not do entirely without any; she must have something to write\r\nabout, even to her niece; and being so soon to lose all the benefit of\r\nDr. Grant’s gouty symptoms and Mrs. Grant’s morning calls, it was very\r\nhard upon her to be deprived of one of the last epistolary uses she\r\ncould put them to.', '“This distressing intelligence, as you may suppose,” observed her\r\nladyship, after giving the substance of it, “has agitated us\r\nexceedingly, and we cannot prevent ourselves from being greatly alarmed\r\nand apprehensive for the poor invalid, whose state Sir Thomas fears may\r\nbe very critical; and Edmund kindly proposes attending his brother\r\nimmediately, but I am happy to add that Sir Thomas will not leave me on\r\nthis distressing occasion, as it would be too trying for me.', 'We shall\r\ngreatly miss Edmund in our small circle, but I trust and hope he will\r\nfind the poor invalid in a less alarming state than might be\r\napprehended, and that he will be able to bring him to Mansfield\r\nshortly, which Sir Thomas proposes should be done, and thinks best on\r\nevery account, and I flatter myself the poor sufferer will soon be able\r\nto bear the removal without material inconvenience or injury.', 'I am quite grieved for him, and very much frightened, and so\r\nis Sir Thomas; and how glad I should be if you were here to comfort me.', 'But Sir Thomas hopes he will be better to-morrow, and says we must\r\nconsider his journey.”\r\n\r\nThe real solicitude now awakened in the maternal bosom was not soon\r\nover.', 'His aunt worried him by\r\nher cares, and Sir Thomas knew not how to bring down his conversation\r\nor his voice to the level of irritation and feebleness.', 'Poor Sir Thomas will feel\r\nit dreadfully.', 'I\r\ndon’t know what Sir Thomas may think of such matters; he may be too\r\nmuch of the courtier and fine gentleman to like his daughter the less.', 'Lady Bertram did not think deeply, but,\r\nguided by Sir Thomas, she thought justly on all important points; and\r\nshe saw, therefore, in all its enormity, what had happened, and neither\r\nendeavoured herself, nor required Fanny to advise her, to think little\r\nof guilt and infamy.', 'Her\r\naunt was no very methodical narrator, but with the help of some letters\r\nto and from Sir Thomas, and what she already knew herself, and could\r\nreasonably combine, she was soon able to understand quite as much as\r\nshe wished of the circumstances attending the story.', 'Very soon\r\nafter the Rushworths’ return to Wimpole Street, Sir Thomas had received\r\na letter from an old and most particular friend in London, who hearing\r\nand witnessing a good deal to alarm him in that quarter, wrote to\r\nrecommend Sir Thomas’s coming to London himself, and using his\r\ninfluence with his daughter to put an end to the intimacy which was\r\nalready exposing her to unpleasant remarks, and evidently making Mr.\r\nRushworth uneasy.', 'Mr. Crawford would\r\nhave fully acquitted her conduct in refusing him; but this, though most\r\nmaterial to herself, would be poor consolation to Sir Thomas.', 'It was of a much less poignant nature than what the\r\nothers excited; but Sir Thomas was considering his happiness as very\r\ndeeply involved in the offence of his sister and friend; cut off by it,\r\nas he must be, from the woman whom he had been pursuing with undoubted\r\nattachment and strong probability of success; and who, in everything\r\nbut this despicable brother, would have been so eligible a connexion.', 'Fanny was not in the secret of her uncle’s feelings, Sir Thomas\r\nnot in the secret of Miss Crawford’s character.', 'Let Sir Thomas\r\ntrust to his honour and compassion, and it may all end well; but if he\r\nget his daughter away, it will be destroying the chief hold.’”\r\n\r\nAfter repeating this, Edmund was so much affected that Fanny, watching\r\nhim with silent, but most tender concern, was almost sorry that the\r\nsubject had been entered on at all.', 'Sir Thomas, poor Sir Thomas, a parent, and conscious of errors in his\r\nown conduct as a parent, was the longest to suffer.', 'and quite as soon as Sir Thomas could place\r\ndependence on such sources of good, Edmund was contributing to his\r\nfather’s ease by improvement in the only point in which he had given\r\nhim pain before—improvement in his spirits.', 'These were the circumstances and the hopes which gradually brought\r\ntheir alleviation to Sir Thomas, deadening his sense of what was lost,\r\nand in part reconciling him to himself; though the anguish arising from\r\nthe conviction of his own errors in the education of his daughters was\r\nnever to be entirely done away.', 'She persisted in placing his\r\nscruples to _her_ account, though Sir Thomas very solemnly assured her\r\nthat, had there been no young woman in question, had there been no\r\nyoung person of either sex belonging to him, to be endangered by the\r\nsociety or hurt by the character of Mrs. Rushworth, he would never have\r\noffered so great an insult to the neighbourhood as to expect it to\r\nnotice her.', 'Mrs. Norris’s removal from Mansfield was the great supplementary\r\ncomfort of Sir Thomas’s life.', 'It was a match which Sir Thomas’s\r\nwishes had even forestalled.', 'In _her_ usefulness, in Fanny’s excellence, in\r\nWilliam’s continued good conduct and rising fame, and in the general\r\nwell-doing and success of the other members of the family, all\r\nassisting to advance each other, and doing credit to his countenance\r\nand aid, Sir Thomas saw repeated, and for ever repeated, reason to\r\nrejoice in what he had done for them all, and acknowledge the\r\nadvantages of early hardship and discipline, and the consciousness of\r\nbeing born to struggle and endure.']

['If they profess a disinclination for\r\nit, I only set it down that they have not yet seen the right person.”\r\n\r\nDr. Grant laughingly congratulated Miss Crawford on feeling no\r\ndisinclination to the state herself.', 'It delighted Mrs. Grant to keep them\r\nboth with her, and Dr. Grant was exceedingly well contented to have it\r\nso: a talking pretty young woman like Miss Crawford is always pleasant\r\nsociety to an indolent, stay-at-home man; and Mr. Crawford’s being his\r\nguest was an excuse for drinking claret every day.', 'The Miss Bertrams’ admiration of Mr. Crawford was more rapturous than\r\nanything which Miss Crawford’s habits made her likely to feel.', '“I begin now to understand you all, except\r\nMiss Price,” said Miss Crawford, as she was walking with the Mr.\r\nBertrams.', 'I felt that I\r\nmust be the jest of the room at the time, and Miss Crawford, it is\r\nplain, has heard the story.”\r\n\r\n“And a very pretty story it is, and with more truth in it, I dare say,\r\nthan does credit to Miss Anderson.', 'They are always acting upon motives of vanity, and there is\r\nno more real modesty in their behaviour _before_ they appear in public\r\nthan afterwards.”\r\n\r\n“I do not know,” replied Miss Crawford hesitatingly.', 'Miss Price is not out.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Bertram set off for————, and Miss Crawford was prepared to find a\r\ngreat chasm in their society, and to miss him decidedly in the meetings\r\nwhich were now becoming almost daily between the families; and on their\r\nall dining together at the Park soon after his going, she retook her\r\nchosen place near the bottom of the table, fully expecting to feel a\r\nmost melancholy difference in the change of masters.', 'Whenever I do see it, you will tell me how it\r\nhas been altered.”\r\n\r\n“I collect,” said Miss Crawford, “that Sotherton is an old place, and a\r\nplace of some grandeur.', 'Henry is\r\ndifferent; he loves to be doing.”\r\n\r\nEdmund was sorry to hear Miss Crawford, whom he was much disposed to\r\nadmire, speak so freely of her uncle.', '“I shall be most happy to play to you both,” said Miss Crawford; “at\r\nleast as long as you can like to listen: probably much longer, for I\r\ndearly love music myself, and where the natural taste is equal the\r\nplayer must always be best off, for she is gratified in more ways than\r\none.', 'CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\n“Well, Fanny, and how do you like Miss Crawford _now_?” said Edmund the\r\nnext day, after thinking some time on the subject himself.', 'I do not pretend to know which\r\nwas most to blame in their disagreements, though the Admiral’s present\r\nconduct might incline one to the side of his wife; but it is natural\r\nand amiable that Miss Crawford should acquit her aunt entirely.', 'And\r\nwhat right had she to suppose that _you_ would not write long letters\r\nwhen you were absent?”\r\n\r\n“The right of a lively mind, Fanny, seizing whatever may contribute to\r\nits own amusement or that of others; perfectly allowable, when\r\nuntinctured by ill-humour or roughness; and there is not a shadow of\r\neither in the countenance or manner of Miss Crawford: nothing sharp, or\r\nloud, or coarse.', 'I am glad you saw\r\nit all as I did.”\r\n\r\nHaving formed her mind and gained her affections, he had a good chance\r\nof her thinking like him; though at this period, and on this subject,\r\nthere began now to be some danger of dissimilarity, for he was in a\r\nline of admiration of Miss Crawford, which might lead him where Fanny\r\ncould not follow.', 'There was a charm, perhaps, in his sincerity, his steadiness,\r\nhis integrity, which Miss Crawford might be equal to feel, though not\r\nequal to discuss with herself.', 'She was a\r\nlittle surprised that he could spend so many hours with Miss Crawford,\r\nand not see more of the sort of fault which he had already observed,\r\nand of which _she_ was almost always reminded by a something of the\r\nsame nature whenever she was in her company; but so it was.', 'Edmund was\r\nfond of speaking to her of Miss Crawford, but he seemed to think it\r\nenough that the Admiral had since been spared; and she scrupled to\r\npoint out her own remarks to him, lest it should appear like\r\nill-nature.', 'The first actual pain which Miss Crawford occasioned her\r\nwas the consequence of an inclination to learn to ride, which the\r\nformer caught, soon after her being settled at Mansfield, from the\r\nexample of the young ladies at the Park, and which, when Edmund’s\r\nacquaintance with her increased, led to his encouraging the wish, and\r\nthe offer of his own quiet mare for the purpose of her first attempts,\r\nas the best fitted for a beginner that either stable could furnish.', 'The houses, though scarcely half a mile apart, were not within sight of\r\neach other; but, by walking fifty yards from the hall door, she could\r\nlook down the park, and command a view of the Parsonage and all its\r\ndemesnes, gently rising beyond the village road; and in Dr. Grant’s\r\nmeadow she immediately saw the group—Edmund and Miss Crawford both on\r\nhorse-back, riding side by side, Dr. and Mrs. Grant, and Mr. Crawford,\r\nwith two or three grooms, standing about and looking on.', 'Her feelings for one and the other were soon a little tranquillised by\r\nseeing the party in the meadow disperse, and Miss Crawford still on\r\nhorseback, but attended by Edmund on foot, pass through a gate into the\r\nlane, and so into the park, and make towards the spot where she stood.', '“My dear Miss Price,” said Miss Crawford, as soon as she was at all\r\nwithin hearing, “I am come to make my own apologies for keeping you\r\nwaiting; but I have nothing in the world to say for myself—I knew it\r\nwas very late, and that I was behaving extremely ill; and therefore, if\r\nyou please, you must forgive me.', 'Miss Price, I give way\r\nto you with a very bad grace; but I sincerely hope you will have a\r\npleasant ride, and that I may have nothing but good to hear of this\r\ndear, delightful, beautiful animal.”\r\n\r\nThe old coachman, who had been waiting about with his own horse, now\r\njoining them, Fanny was lifted on hers, and they set off across another\r\npart of the park; her feelings of discomfort not lightened by seeing,\r\nas she looked back, that the others were walking down the hill together\r\nto the village; nor did her attendant do her much good by his comments\r\non Miss Crawford’s great cleverness as a horse-woman, which he had been\r\nwatching with an interest almost equal to her own.', 'how you did tremble\r\nwhen Sir Thomas first had you put on!”\r\n\r\nIn the drawing-room Miss Crawford was also celebrated.', '“I do not want her at all for myself,” said he; “but whenever you are\r\nnext inclined to stay at home, I think Miss Crawford would be glad to\r\nhave her a longer time—for a whole morning, in short.', 'He was ashamed\r\nto think that for four days together she had not had the power of\r\nriding, and very seriously resolved, however unwilling he must be to\r\ncheck a pleasure of Miss Crawford’s, that it should never happen again.', 'Before his return Mrs. Grant and Miss Crawford came in.', 'I cannot do without Fanny.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Rushworth proceeded next, under the conviction that everybody must\r\nbe wanting to see Sotherton, to include Miss Crawford in the\r\ninvitation; and though Mrs. Grant, who had not been at the trouble of\r\nvisiting Mrs. Rushworth, on her coming into the neighbourhood, civilly\r\ndeclined it on her own account, she was glad to secure any pleasure for\r\nher sister; and Mary, properly pressed and persuaded, was not long in\r\naccepting her share of the civility.', 'On his return to the breakfast-room, he found Mrs. Norris trying to\r\nmake up her mind as to whether Miss Crawford’s being of the party were\r\ndesirable or not, or whether her brother’s barouche would not be full\r\nwithout her.', 'Probably Miss Crawford will choose the barouche-box\r\nherself.”\r\n\r\n“There can be no objection, then, to Fanny’s going with you; there can\r\nbe no doubt of your having room for her.”\r\n\r\n“Fanny!” repeated Mrs. Norris; “my dear Edmund, there is no idea of her\r\ngoing with us.', 'That was the only point of resemblance\r\nbetween her and the lady who sat by her: in everything but a value for\r\nEdmund, Miss Crawford was very unlike her.', '; but her only offer of exchange\r\nwas addressed to Miss Crawford, as they gained the summit of a long\r\nhill, and was not more inviting than this: “Here is a fine burst of\r\ncountry.', 'I wish you had my seat, but I dare say you will not take it,\r\nlet me press you ever so much;” and Miss Crawford could hardly answer\r\nbefore they were moving again at a good pace.', 'She could not tell Miss Crawford that\r\n“those woods belonged to Sotherton,” she could not carelessly observe\r\nthat “she believed that it was now all Mr. Rushworth’s property on each\r\nside of the road,” without elation of heart; and it was a pleasure to\r\nincrease with their approach to the capital freehold mansion, and\r\nancient manorial residence of the family, with all its rights of\r\ncourt-leet and court-baron.', '“Now we shall have no more rough road, Miss Crawford; our difficulties\r\nare over.', 'On the present occasion she addressed\r\nherself chiefly to Miss Crawford and Fanny, but there was no comparison\r\nin the willingness of their attention; for Miss Crawford, who had seen\r\nscores of great houses, and cared for none of them, had only the\r\nappearance of civilly listening, while Fanny, to whom everything was\r\nalmost as interesting as it was new, attended with unaffected\r\nearnestness to all that Mrs. Rushworth could relate of the family in\r\nformer times, its rise and grandeur, regal visits and loyal efforts,\r\ndelighted to connect anything with history already known, or warm her\r\nimagination with scenes of the past.', 'Prayers were always read in it by the domestic chaplain, within the\r\nmemory of many; but the late Mr. Rushworth left it off.”\r\n\r\n“Every generation has its improvements,” said Miss Crawford, with a\r\nsmile, to Edmund.', 'Mrs. Rushworth was gone to repeat her lesson to Mr. Crawford; and\r\nEdmund, Fanny, and Miss Crawford remained in a cluster together.', 'A whole\r\nfamily assembling regularly for the purpose of prayer is fine!”\r\n\r\n“Very fine indeed,” said Miss Crawford, laughing.', '“If Edmund were but in orders!” cried Julia, and running to where he\r\nstood with Miss Crawford and Fanny: “My dear Edmund, if you were but in\r\norders now, you might perform the ceremony directly.', '“Ordained!” said Miss Crawford; “what, are you to be a clergyman?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I shall take orders soon after my father’s return—probably at\r\nChristmas.”\r\n\r\nMiss Crawford, rallying her spirits, and recovering her complexion,\r\nreplied only, “If I had known this before, I would have spoken of the\r\ncloth with more respect,” and turned the subject.', 'Mr. Crawford was soon followed by Miss Bertram and Mr.\r\nRushworth; and when, after a little time, the others began to form into\r\nparties, these three were found in busy consultation on the terrace by\r\nEdmund, Miss Crawford, and Fanny, who seemed as naturally to unite, and\r\nwho, after a short participation of their regrets and difficulties,\r\nleft them and walked on.', '“This is insufferably hot,” said Miss Crawford, when they had taken one\r\nturn on the terrace, and were drawing a second time to the door in the\r\nmiddle which opened to the wilderness.', 'At length, after a short\r\npause, Miss Crawford began with, “So you are to be a clergyman, Mr.\r\nBertram.', 'And with regard to their influencing\r\npublic manners, Miss Crawford must not misunderstand me, or suppose I\r\nmean to call them the arbiters of good-breeding, the regulators of\r\nrefinement and courtesy, the masters of the ceremonies of life.', '“There,” cried Miss Crawford, “you have quite convinced Miss Price\r\nalready.”\r\n\r\n“I wish I could convince Miss Crawford too.”\r\n\r\n“I do not think you ever will,” said she, with an arch smile; “I am\r\njust as much surprised now as I was at first that you should intend to\r\ntake orders.', 'Perhaps,”\r\nturning to Miss Crawford, “my other companion may do me the honour of\r\ntaking an arm.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, but I am not at all tired.” She took it, however, as she\r\nspoke, and the gratification of having her do so, of feeling such a\r\nconnexion for the first time, made him a little forgetful of Fanny.', 'Every sort of exercise fatigues her so\r\nsoon, Miss Crawford, except riding.”\r\n\r\n“How abominable in you, then, to let me engross her horse as I did all\r\nlast week!', 'It is\r\ngenerally allowed to be the greatest bore in the world, and Miss Price\r\nhas found it so, though she did not know it.”\r\n\r\n“I shall soon be rested,” said Fanny; “to sit in the shade on a fine\r\nday, and look upon verdure, is the most perfect refreshment.”\r\n\r\nAfter sitting a little while Miss Crawford was up again.', '“Now, Miss Crawford, if you will look up\r\nthe walk, you will convince yourself that it cannot be half a mile\r\nlong, or half half a mile.”\r\n\r\n“It is an immense distance,” said she; “I see _that_ with a glance.”\r\n\r\nHe still reasoned with her, but in vain.', 'CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour, twenty minutes, passed away, and Fanny was still\r\nthinking of Edmund, Miss Crawford, and herself, without interruption\r\nfrom any one.', 'She could almost have thought that\r\nEdmund and Miss Crawford had left it, but that it was impossible for\r\nEdmund to forget her so entirely.', 'She followed their steps along the bottom walk, and had just\r\nturned up into another, when the voice and the laugh of Miss Crawford\r\nonce more caught her ear; the sound approached, and a few more windings\r\nbrought them before her.', 'Mrs. Norris gave the\r\nparticulars of the letters, and the subject was dropt; but after tea,\r\nas Miss Crawford was standing at an open window with Edmund and Fanny\r\nlooking out on a twilight scene, while the Miss Bertrams, Mr.\r\nRushworth, and Henry Crawford were all busy with candles at the\r\npianoforte, she suddenly revived it by turning round towards the group,\r\nand saying, “How happy Mr. Rushworth looks!', 'His curate\r\ndoes all the work, and the business of his own life is to dine.”\r\n\r\n“There are such clergymen, no doubt, but I think they are not so common\r\nas to justify Miss Crawford in esteeming it their general character.', '“I have been so little addicted to take my opinions from my uncle,”\r\nsaid Miss Crawford, “that I can hardly suppose—and since you push me so\r\nhard, I must observe, that I am not entirely without the means of\r\nseeing what clergymen are, being at this present time the guest of my\r\nown brother, Dr. Grant.', 'It must make him think;\r\nand I have no doubt that he oftener endeavours to restrain himself than\r\nhe would if he had been anything but a clergyman.”\r\n\r\n“We cannot prove to the contrary, to be sure; but I wish you a better\r\nfate, Miss Price, than to be the wife of a man whose amiableness\r\ndepends upon his own sermons; for though he may preach himself into a\r\ngood-humour every Sunday, it will be bad enough to have him quarrelling\r\nabout green geese from Monday morning till Saturday night.”\r\n\r\n“I think the man who could often quarrel with Fanny,” said Edmund\r\naffectionately, “must be beyond the reach of any sermons.”\r\n\r\nFanny turned farther into the window; and Miss Crawford had only time\r\nto say, in a pleasant manner, “I fancy Miss Price has been more used to\r\ndeserve praise than to hear it”; when, being earnestly invited by the\r\nMiss Bertrams to join in a glee, she tripped off to the instrument,\r\nleaving Edmund looking after her in an ecstasy of admiration of all her\r\nmany virtues, from her obliging manners down to her light and graceful\r\ntread.', 'The approach of September brought tidings of Mr.\r\nBertram, first in a letter to the gamekeeper and then in a letter to\r\nEdmund; and by the end of August he arrived himself, to be gay,\r\nagreeable, and gallant again as occasion served, or Miss Crawford\r\ndemanded; to tell of races and Weymouth, and parties and friends, to\r\nwhich she might have listened six weeks before with some interest, and\r\naltogether to give her the fullest conviction, by the power of actual\r\ncomparison, of her preferring his younger brother.', 'Three of the characters were now cast, besides Mr.\r\nRushworth, who was always answered for by Maria as willing to do\r\nanything; when Julia, meaning, like her sister, to be Agatha, began to\r\nbe scrupulous on Miss Crawford’s account.', 'But\r\nthis was immediately opposed by Tom Bertram, who asserted the part of\r\nAmelia to be in every respect the property of Miss Crawford, if she\r\nwould accept it.', 'You _will_ undertake it, I\r\nhope?” turning to her with a look of anxious entreaty, which softened\r\nher a little; but while she hesitated what to say, her brother again\r\ninterposed with Miss Crawford’s better claim.', 'It\r\nis fit for Miss Crawford, and Miss Crawford only.', 'When this had lasted some time, the division of the party was completed\r\nby Tom Bertram and Mr. Yates walking off together to consult farther in\r\nthe room now beginning to be called _the_ _Theatre_, and Miss Bertram’s\r\nresolving to go down to the Parsonage herself with the offer of Amelia\r\nto Miss Crawford; and Fanny remained alone.', 'But the concerns of the theatre were suspended only for an hour or two:\r\nthere was still a great deal to be settled; and the spirits of evening\r\ngiving fresh courage, Tom, Maria, and Mr. Yates, soon after their being\r\nreassembled in the drawing-room, seated themselves in committee at a\r\nseparate table, with the play open before them, and were just getting\r\ndeep in the subject when a most welcome interruption was given by the\r\nentrance of Mr. and Miss Crawford, who, late and dark and dirty as it\r\nwas, could not help coming, and were received with the most grateful\r\njoy.', 'After continuing in chat\r\nwith the party round the fire a few minutes, Miss Crawford returned to\r\nthe party round the table; and standing by them, seemed to interest\r\nherself in their arrangements till, as if struck by a sudden\r\nrecollection, she exclaimed, “My good friends, you are most composedly\r\nat work upon these cottages and alehouses, inside and out; but pray let\r\nme know my fate in the meanwhile.', 'Rushworth was to be Count Cassel, but no one had yet undertaken\r\nAnhalt.”\r\n\r\n“I had my choice of the parts,” said Mr. Rushworth; “but I thought I\r\nshould like the Count best, though I do not much relish the finery I am\r\nto have.”\r\n\r\n“You chose very wisely, I am sure,” replied Miss Crawford, with a\r\nbrightened look; “Anhalt is a heavy part.”\r\n\r\n“_The_ _Count_ has two-and-forty speeches,” returned Mr. Rushworth,\r\n“which is no trifle.”\r\n\r\n“I am not at all surprised,” said Miss Crawford, after a short pause,\r\n“at this want of an Anhalt.', 'Do not urge her any more.”\r\n\r\n“I am not going to urge her,” replied Mrs. Norris sharply; “but I shall\r\nthink her a very obstinate, ungrateful girl, if she does not do what\r\nher aunt and cousins wish her—very ungrateful, indeed, considering who\r\nand what she is.”\r\n\r\nEdmund was too angry to speak; but Miss Crawford, looking for a moment\r\nwith astonished eyes at Mrs. Norris, and then at Fanny, whose tears\r\nwere beginning to shew themselves, immediately said, with some\r\nkeenness, “I do not like my situation: this _place_ is too hot for me,”\r\nand moved away her chair to the opposite side of the table, close to\r\nFanny, saying to her, in a kind, low whisper, as she placed herself,\r\n“Never mind, my dear Miss Price, this is a cross evening: everybody is\r\ncross and teasing, but do not let us mind them”; and with pointed\r\nattention continued to talk to her and endeavour to raise her spirits,\r\nin spite of being out of spirits herself.', 'Fanny did not love Miss Crawford; but she felt very much obliged to her\r\nfor her present kindness; and when, from taking notice of her work, and\r\nwishing _she_ could work as well, and begging for the pattern, and\r\nsupposing Fanny was now preparing for her _appearance_, as of course\r\nshe would come out when her cousin was married, Miss Crawford proceeded\r\nto inquire if she had heard lately from her brother at sea, and said\r\nthat she had quite a curiosity to see him, and imagined him a very fine\r\nyoung man, and advised Fanny to get his picture drawn before he went to\r\nsea again—she could not help admitting it to be very agreeable\r\nflattery, or help listening, and answering with more animation than she\r\nhad intended.', 'The consultation upon the play still went on, and Miss Crawford’s\r\nattention was first called from Fanny by Tom Bertram’s telling her,\r\nwith infinite regret, that he found it absolutely impossible for him to\r\nundertake the part of Anhalt in addition to the Butler: he had been\r\nmost anxiously trying to make it out to be feasible, but it would not\r\ndo; he must give it up.', 'After a moment’s thought, Miss Crawford calmly replied, “As\r\nfar as I am concerned, I can have no objection to anything that you all\r\nthink eligible.', '“I am not very sanguine as to our play,” said Miss Crawford, in an\r\nundervoice to Fanny, after some consideration; “and I can tell Mr.\r\nMaddox that I shall shorten some of _his_ speeches, and a great many of\r\n_my_ _own_, before we rehearse together.', 'It will be very disagreeable,\r\nand by no means what I expected.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not in Miss Crawford’s power to talk Fanny into any real\r\nforgetfulness of what had passed.', 'Put yourself in Miss Crawford’s\r\nplace, Fanny.', 'You\r\nhesitate.”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry for Miss Crawford; but I am more sorry to see you drawn in\r\nto do what you had resolved against, and what you are known to think\r\nwill be disagreeable to my uncle.', 'I thought _you_ would have\r\nentered more into Miss Crawford’s feelings.”\r\n\r\n“No doubt she will be very glad.', 'it was all Miss Crawford’s\r\ndoing.', 'There were not fewer smiles at the Parsonage than at the Park on this\r\nchange in Edmund; Miss Crawford looked very lovely in hers, and entered\r\nwith such an instantaneous renewal of cheerfulness into the whole\r\naffair as could have but one effect on him.', 'One\r\nadvantage resulted from it to Fanny: at the earnest request of Miss\r\nCrawford, Mrs. Grant had, with her usual good-humour, agreed to\r\nundertake the part for which Fanny had been wanted; and this was all\r\nthat occurred to gladden _her_ heart during the day; and even this,\r\nwhen imparted by Edmund, brought a pang with it, for it was Miss\r\nCrawford to whom she was obliged—it was Miss Crawford whose kind\r\nexertions were to excite her gratitude, and whose merit in making them\r\nwas spoken of with a glow of admiration.', 'Edmund, between his theatrical and his real\r\npart, between Miss Crawford’s claims and his own conduct, between love\r\nand consistency, was equally unobservant; and Mrs. Norris was too busy\r\nin contriving and directing the general little matters of the company,\r\nsuperintending their various dresses with economical expedient, for\r\nwhich nobody thanked her, and saving, with delighted integrity, half a\r\ncrown here and there to the absent Sir Thomas, to have leisure for\r\nwatching the behaviour, or guarding the happiness of his daughters.', 'Fanny did not share her\r\naunt’s composure: she thought of the morrow a great deal, for if the\r\nthree acts were rehearsed, Edmund and Miss Crawford would then be\r\nacting together for the first time; the third act would bring a scene\r\nbetween them which interested her most particularly, and which she was\r\nlonging and dreading to see how they would perform.', 'A glimpse, as she passed through the hall, of the two ladies\r\nwalking up from the Parsonage made no change in her wish of retreat,\r\nand she worked and meditated in the East room, undisturbed, for a\r\nquarter of an hour, when a gentle tap at the door was followed by the\r\nentrance of Miss Crawford.', 'With such an Anhalt, however, Miss Crawford had courage enough;\r\nand they had got through half the scene, when a tap at the door brought\r\na pause, and the entrance of Edmund, the next moment, suspended it all.', 'Surprise, consciousness, and pleasure appeared in each of the three on\r\nthis unexpected meeting; and as Edmund was come on the very same\r\nbusiness that had brought Miss Crawford, consciousness and pleasure\r\nwere likely to be more than momentary in _them_.', 'He too had his book,\r\nand was seeking Fanny, to ask her to rehearse with him, and help him to\r\nprepare for the evening, without knowing Miss Crawford to be in the\r\nhouse; and great was the joy and animation of being thus thrown\r\ntogether, of comparing schemes, and sympathising in praise of Fanny’s\r\nkind offices.', 'Why was\r\nnot Miss Crawford to be applied to as well?', '“Where did you leave Miss Crawford, Fanny?”\r\n\r\nFanny told of their departure, and delivered their message.', 'and Miss Crawford were\r\nmentioned in my last letters from Mansfield.', 'I do not call Tunbridge or Cheltenham the country; and\r\nNovember is a still more serious month, and I can see that Mrs. Grant\r\nis very anxious for her not finding Mansfield dull as winter comes on.”\r\n\r\nFanny could have said a great deal, but it was safer to say nothing,\r\nand leave untouched all Miss Crawford’s resources—her accomplishments,\r\nher spirits, her importance, her friends, lest it should betray her\r\ninto any observations seemingly unhandsome.', 'A civil servant she had withstood; but when Dr. Grant\r\nhimself went out with an umbrella, there was nothing to be done but to\r\nbe very much ashamed, and to get into the house as fast as possible;\r\nand to poor Miss Crawford, who had just been contemplating the dismal\r\nrain in a very desponding state of mind, sighing over the ruin of all\r\nher plan of exercise for that morning, and of every chance of seeing a\r\nsingle creature beyond themselves for the next twenty-four hours, the\r\nsound of a little bustle at the front door, and the sight of Miss Price\r\ndripping with wet in the vestibule, was delightful.', 'She was all alive again directly, and among the most active in being\r\nuseful to Fanny, in detecting her to be wetter than she would at first\r\nallow, and providing her with dry clothes; and Fanny, after being\r\nobliged to submit to all this attention, and to being assisted and\r\nwaited on by mistresses and maids, being also obliged, on returning\r\ndownstairs, to be fixed in their drawing-room for an hour while the\r\nrain continued, the blessing of something fresh to see and think of was\r\nthus extended to Miss Crawford, and might carry on her spirits to the\r\nperiod of dressing and dinner.', '“Another quarter of an hour,” said Miss Crawford, “and we shall see how\r\nit will be.', 'Such was the origin of the sort of intimacy which took place between\r\nthem within the first fortnight after the Miss Bertrams’ going away—an\r\nintimacy resulting principally from Miss Crawford’s desire of something\r\nnew, and which had little reality in Fanny’s feelings.', 'Not too much attempted!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Miss Crawford carelessly, “it does very well for a place\r\nof this sort.', 'One cannot fix one’s eyes on the\r\ncommonest natural production without finding food for a rambling\r\nfancy.”\r\n\r\n“To say the truth,” replied Miss Crawford, “I am something like the\r\nfamous Doge at the court of Lewis XIV.', 'Such a match as Miss Bertram has made is a public\r\nblessing; for the first pleasures of Mr. Rushworth’s wife must be to\r\nfill her house, and give the best balls in the country.”\r\n\r\nFanny was silent, and Miss Crawford relapsed into thoughtfulness, till\r\nsuddenly looking up at the end of a few minutes, she exclaimed, “Ah!', '“Well,” said Miss Crawford, “and do you not scold us for our\r\nimprudence?', 'We may sometimes take greater\r\nliberties in November than in May.”\r\n\r\n“Upon my word,” cried Miss Crawford, “you are two of the most\r\ndisappointing and unfeeling kind friends I ever met with!', 'These are something like\r\ngrievances, and make me think the weather most unseasonably close.”\r\n\r\n“The sweets of housekeeping in a country village!” said Miss Crawford\r\narchly.', 'No,\r\nMiss Crawford,” he added, in a more serious tone, “there _are_\r\ndistinctions which I should be miserable if I thought myself without\r\nany chance—absolutely without chance or possibility of obtaining—but\r\nthey are of a different character.”\r\n\r\nA look of consciousness as he spoke, and what seemed a consciousness of\r\nmanner on Miss Crawford’s side as she made some laughing answer, was\r\nsorrowfull food for Fanny’s observation; and finding herself quite\r\nunable to attend as she ought to Mrs. Grant, by whose side she was now\r\nfollowing the others, she had nearly resolved on going home\r\nimmediately, and only waited for courage to say so, when the sound of\r\nthe great clock at Mansfield Park, striking three, made her feel that\r\nshe had really been much longer absent than usual, and brought the\r\nprevious self-inquiry of whether she should take leave or not just\r\nthen, and how, to a very speedy issue.', 'Remember, wherever you are, you must be the lowest and\r\nlast; and though Miss Crawford is in a manner at home at the Parsonage,\r\nyou are not to be taking place of her.', 'Has not Miss Crawford a gown\r\nsomething the same?”\r\n\r\nIn approaching the Parsonage they passed close by the stable-yard and\r\ncoach-house.', '“No, he can feel nothing as he\r\nought.”\r\n\r\nThe party being now all united, and the chief talkers attracting each\r\nother, she remained in tranquillity; and as a whist-table was formed\r\nafter tea—formed really for the amusement of Dr. Grant, by his\r\nattentive wife, though it was not to be supposed so—and Miss Crawford\r\ntook her harp, she had nothing to do but to listen; and her\r\ntranquillity remained undisturbed the rest of the evening, except when\r\nMr. Crawford now and then addressed to her a question or observation,\r\nwhich she could not avoid answering.', 'Well, you\r\nwill have opportunities enough of endeavouring to recommend yourself,\r\nfor we are a great deal together.”\r\n\r\nAnd without attempting any farther remonstrance, she left Fanny to her\r\nfate, a fate which, had not Fanny’s heart been guarded in a way\r\nunsuspected by Miss Crawford, might have been a little harder than she\r\ndeserved; for although there doubtless are such unconquerable young\r\nladies of eighteen (or one should not read about them) as are never to\r\nbe persuaded into love against their judgment by all that talent,\r\nmanner, attention, and flattery can do, I have no inclination to\r\nbelieve Fanny one of them, or to think that with so much tenderness of\r\ndisposition, and so much taste as belonged to her, she could have\r\nescaped heart-whole from the courtship (though the courtship only of a\r\nfortnight) of such a man as Crawford, in spite of there being some\r\nprevious ill opinion of him to be overcome, had not her affection been\r\nengaged elsewhere.', 'I had forgotten having ever told you half so\r\nmuch of the place.”\r\n\r\nThornton Lacey was the name of his impending living, as Miss Crawford\r\nwell knew; and her interest in a negotiation for William Price’s knave\r\nincreased.', 'It is\r\nnot a scrambling collection of low single rooms, with as many roofs as\r\nwindows; it is not cramped into the vulgar compactness of a square\r\nfarmhouse: it is a solid, roomy, mansion-like looking house, such as\r\none might suppose a respectable old country family had lived in from\r\ngeneration to generation, through two centuries at least, and were now\r\nspending from two to three thousand a year in.” Miss Crawford listened,\r\nand Edmund agreed to this.', 'Bertram,” said Miss Crawford, a few minutes afterwards, “you know\r\nHenry to be such a capital improver, that you cannot possibly engage in\r\nanything of the sort at Thornton Lacey without accepting his help.', 'He knew his own mind, but he\r\nwas not always perfectly assured of knowing Miss Crawford’s.', 'In every meeting there was a hope of\r\nreceiving farther confirmation of Miss Crawford’s attachment; but the\r\nwhirl of a ballroom, perhaps, was not particularly favourable to the\r\nexcitement or expression of serious feelings.', 'She met Miss Crawford within a few yards of the Parsonage, just setting\r\nout to call on her, and as it seemed to her that her friend, though\r\nobliged to insist on turning back, was unwilling to lose her walk, she\r\nexplained her business at once, and observed, that if she would be so\r\nkind as to give her opinion, it might be all talked over as well\r\nwithout doors as within.', 'The dress being settled in\r\nall its grander parts—“But what shall you have by way of necklace?”\r\nsaid Miss Crawford.', 'Such had been the parcel with which Miss Crawford\r\nwas provided, and such the object of her intended visit: and in the\r\nkindest manner she now urged Fanny’s taking one for the cross and to\r\nkeep for her sake, saying everything she could think of to obviate the\r\nscruples which were making Fanny start back at first with a look of\r\nhorror at the proposal.', 'But Miss Crawford persevered, and argued the case with so much\r\naffectionate earnestness through all the heads of William and the\r\ncross, and the ball, and herself, as to be finally successful.', 'It was\r\nof gold, prettily worked; and though Fanny would have preferred a\r\nlonger and a plainer chain as more adapted for her purpose, she hoped,\r\nin fixing on this, to be chusing what Miss Crawford least wished to\r\nkeep.', '“When I wear this necklace I\r\nshall always think of you,” said she, “and feel how very kind you\r\nwere.”\r\n\r\n“You must think of somebody else too, when you wear that necklace,”\r\nreplied Miss Crawford.', '“Well, then,” replied Miss Crawford more seriously, but without at all\r\nbelieving her, “to convince me that you suspect no trick, and are as\r\nunsuspicious of compliment as I have always found you, take the\r\nnecklace and say no more about it.', 'Such a trifle is not worth half so many\r\nwords.”\r\n\r\nFanny dared not make any farther opposition; and with renewed but less\r\nhappy thanks accepted the necklace again, for there was an expression\r\nin Miss Crawford’s eyes which she could not be satisfied with.', 'He would marry Miss Crawford.', 'Could she believe Miss Crawford to deserve him, it would\r\nbe—oh, how different would it be—how far more tolerable!', 'To think of him as Miss Crawford might be\r\njustified in thinking, would in her be insanity.', '“I\r\nwished to engage Miss Crawford for the two first dances,” was the\r\nexplanation that followed, and brought Fanny to life again, enabling\r\nher, as she found she was expected to speak, to utter something like an\r\ninquiry as to the result.', '“Dearest Fanny!” cried Edmund, pressing her hand to his lips with\r\nalmost as much warmth as if it had been Miss Crawford’s, “you are all\r\nconsiderate thought!', 'For Fanny’s present comfort it was\r\nconcluded, perhaps, at the happiest moment: had he been able to talk\r\nanother five minutes, there is no saying that he might not have talked\r\naway all Miss Crawford’s faults and his own despondence.', 'All went well:\r\nshe did not dislike her own looks; and when she came to the necklaces\r\nagain, her good fortune seemed complete, for upon trial the one given\r\nher by Miss Crawford would by no means go through the ring of the\r\ncross.', 'His, therefore, must be worn; and having, with\r\ndelightful feelings, joined the chain and the cross—those memorials of\r\nthe two most beloved of her heart, those dearest tokens so formed for\r\neach other by everything real and imaginary—and put them round her\r\nneck, and seen and felt how full of William and Edmund they were, she\r\nwas able, without an effort, to resolve on wearing Miss Crawford’s\r\nnecklace too.', 'When the company were moving into the ballroom, she found herself for\r\nthe first time near Miss Crawford, whose eyes and smiles were\r\nimmediately and more unequivocally directed as her brother’s had been,\r\nand who was beginning to speak on the subject, when Fanny, anxious to\r\nget the story over, hastened to give the explanation of the second\r\nnecklace: the real chain.', 'Whenever she had thought of the minutiae of the evening, it had been as\r\na matter of course that Edmund would begin with Miss Crawford; and the\r\nimpression was so strong, that though _her_ _uncle_ spoke the contrary,\r\nshe could not help an exclamation of surprise, a hint of her unfitness,\r\nan entreaty even to be excused.', '“Well, then,” replied Miss Crawford, laughing, “I must suppose it to be\r\npurely for the pleasure of conveying your brother, and of talking of\r\nyou by the way.”\r\n\r\nFanny was confused, but it was the confusion of discontent; while Miss\r\nCrawford wondered she did not smile, and thought her over-anxious, or\r\nthought her odd, or thought her anything rather than insensible of\r\npleasure in Henry’s attentions.', 'I never heard.”\r\n\r\n“That is the first question, you know,” said Miss Crawford, trying to\r\nappear gay and unconcerned, “which every woman who plays herself is\r\nsure to ask about another.', 'I shall not be in any\r\ndoubtful, or distant, or unapproachable region.”\r\n\r\nNow Fanny could not bring herself to speak, and Miss Crawford was\r\ndisappointed; for she had hoped to hear some pleasant assurance of her\r\npower from one who she thought must know, and her spirits were clouded\r\nagain.', 'But\r\nhonestly now, do not you rather expect it than otherwise?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Fanny stoutly, “I do not expect it at all.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all!” cried Miss Crawford with alacrity.', 'I think I\r\nwill have two shawls, Fanny.”\r\n\r\nFanny, meanwhile, speaking only when she could not help it, was very\r\nearnestly trying to understand what Mr. and Miss Crawford were at.', 'She had read Miss Crawford’s note only once, and\r\nhow to reply to anything so imperfectly understood was most\r\ndistressing.', 'Quite unpractised in such sort of note-writing, had there\r\nbeen time for scruples and fears as to style she would have felt them\r\nin abundance: but something must be instantly written; and with only\r\none decided feeling, that of wishing not to appear to think anything\r\nreally intended, she wrote thus, in great trembling both of spirits and\r\nhand—\r\n\r\n“I am very much obliged to you, my dear Miss Crawford, for your kind\r\ncongratulations, as far as they relate to my dearest William.', 'With thanks for the honour\r\nof your note,\r\n\r\n\r\nI remain, dear Miss Crawford,\r\n&c., &c.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conclusion was scarcely intelligible from increasing fright, for\r\nshe found that Mr. Crawford, under pretence of receiving the note, was\r\ncoming towards her.', 'I thank you; I have quite done, just done; it will be ready in a\r\nmoment; I am very much obliged to you; if you will be so good as to\r\ngive _that_ to Miss Crawford.”\r\n\r\nThe note was held out, and must be taken; and as she instantly and with\r\naverted eyes walked towards the fireplace, where sat the others, he had\r\nnothing to do but to go in good earnest.', 'And why it was not done already she could\r\nnot devise, for Miss Crawford certainly wanted no delay.', 'His absence had been extended beyond a fortnight\r\npurposely to avoid Miss Crawford.', 'Mrs. Grant laughed at her for her rapidity.”\r\n\r\n“Was Mrs. Grant in the room, then?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, when I reached the house I found the two sisters together by\r\nthemselves; and when once we had begun, we had not done with you,\r\nFanny, till Crawford and Dr. Grant came in.”\r\n\r\n“It is above a week since I saw Miss Crawford.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, she laments it; yet owns it may have been best.', 'She feared she had been doing wrong:\r\nsaying too much, overacting the caution which she had been fancying\r\nnecessary; in guarding against one evil, laying herself open to\r\nanother; and to have Miss Crawford’s liveliness repeated to her at such\r\na moment, and on such a subject, was a bitter aggravation.', 'You and Miss Crawford have made me\r\ntoo nice.”\r\n\r\nStill, however, Fanny was oppressed and wearied; he saw it in her\r\nlooks, it could not be talked away; and attempting it no more, he led\r\nher directly, with the kind authority of a privileged guardian, into\r\nthe house.', 'The promised visit from “her friend,” as Edmund called Miss Crawford,\r\nwas a formidable threat to Fanny, and she lived in continual terror of\r\nit.', 'She was safe in the breakfast-room, with her aunt, when\r\nMiss Crawford did come; and the first misery over, and Miss Crawford\r\nlooking and speaking with much less particularity of expression than\r\nshe had anticipated, Fanny began to hope there would be nothing worse\r\nto be endured than a half-hour of moderate agitation.', 'But here she\r\nhoped too much; Miss Crawford was not the slave of opportunity.', 'They were no sooner in the hall than all restraint of countenance was\r\nover on Miss Crawford’s side.', 'But the evil ready to burst on her was at\r\nleast delayed by the sudden change in Miss Crawford’s ideas; by the\r\nstrong effect on her mind which the finding herself in the East room\r\nagain produced.', 'She had not foreseen anything of this, and her\r\nfeelings could seldom withstand the melancholy influence of the word\r\n“last.” She cried as if she had loved Miss Crawford more than she\r\npossibly could; and Miss Crawford, yet farther softened by the sight of\r\nsuch emotion, hung about her with fondness, and said, “I hate to leave\r\nyou.', 'Her disposition was peculiarly calculated to value a fond\r\ntreatment, and from having hitherto known so little of it, she was the\r\nmore overcome by Miss Crawford’s.', 'In their very last conversation, Miss Crawford, in spite of some\r\namiable sensations, and much personal kindness, had still been Miss\r\nCrawford; still shewn a mind led astray and bewildered, and without any\r\nsuspicion of being so; darkened, yet fancying itself light.', 'Experience might have hoped more for any young people so circumstanced,\r\nand impartiality would not have denied to Miss Crawford’s nature that\r\nparticipation of the general nature of women which would lead her to\r\nadopt the opinions of the man she loved and respected as her own.', 'But\r\nas such were Fanny’s persuasions, she suffered very much from them, and\r\ncould never speak of Miss Crawford without pain.', 'It made the substance of one other confidential discourse\r\nabout Miss Crawford; and Fanny was the more affected from feeling it to\r\nbe the last time in which Miss Crawford’s name would ever be mentioned\r\nbetween them with any remains of liberty.', 'CHAPTER XL\r\n\r\n\r\nFanny was right enough in not expecting to hear from Miss Crawford now\r\nat the rapid rate in which their correspondence had begun; Mary’s next\r\nletter was after a decidedly longer interval than the last, but she was\r\nnot right in supposing that such an interval would be felt a great\r\nrelief to herself.', 'How Miss Crawford really felt, how she meant to act, or might act\r\nwithout or against her meaning; whether his importance to her were\r\nquite what it had been before the last separation; whether, if\r\nlessened, it were likely to lessen more, or to recover itself, were\r\nsubjects for endless conjecture, and to be thought of on that day and\r\nmany days to come, without producing any conclusion.', 'The idea that\r\nreturned the oftenest was that Miss Crawford, after proving herself\r\ncooled and staggered by a return to London habits, would yet prove\r\nherself in the end too much attached to him to give him up.', 'Yet there was no saying what Miss Crawford\r\nmight not ask.', 'That Miss Crawford should endeavour to secure a\r\nmeeting between him and Mrs. Rushworth, was all in her worst line of\r\nconduct, and grossly unkind and ill-judged; but she hoped _he_ would\r\nnot be actuated by any such degrading curiosity.', 'So very fond of\r\nyou as Miss Crawford is, it is most natural that she should tell you\r\nenough of her own feelings to furnish a tolerable guess at mine.', 'She could just find selfishness enough to wonder\r\nwhether Edmund _had_ written to Miss Crawford before this summons came,\r\nbut no sentiment dwelt long with her that was not purely affectionate\r\nand disinterestedly anxious.', 'The family were not consumptive, and she was more inclined to hope than\r\nfear for her cousin, except when she thought of Miss Crawford; but Miss\r\nCrawford gave her the idea of being the child of good luck, and to her\r\nselfishness and vanity it would be good luck to have Edmund the only\r\nson.', 'She\r\nthanked Miss Crawford, but gave a decided negative.', 'If\r\ntwo moments, however, can surround with difficulties, a third can\r\ndisperse them; and before she had opened the letter, the possibility of\r\nMr. and Miss Crawford’s having applied to her uncle and obtained his\r\npermission was giving her ease.', 'She could only perceive that it must relate to Wimpole Street\r\nand Mr. Crawford, and only conjecture that something very imprudent had\r\njust occurred in that quarter to draw the notice of the world, and to\r\nexcite her jealousy, in Miss Crawford’s apprehension, if she heard it.', 'If the Rushworths were gone themselves\r\nto Mansfield, as was to be inferred from what Miss Crawford said, it\r\nwas not likely that anything unpleasant should have preceded them, or\r\nat least should make any impression.', 'Her eager defence of her brother, her hope of its being\r\n_hushed_ _up_, her evident agitation, were all of a piece with\r\nsomething very bad; and if there was a woman of character in existence,\r\nwho could treat as a trifle this sin of the first magnitude, who would\r\ntry to gloss it over, and desire to have it unpunished, she could\r\nbelieve Miss Crawford to be the woman!', '_His_\r\nunsettled affections, wavering with his vanity, _Maria’s_ decided\r\nattachment, and no sufficient principle on either side, gave it\r\npossibility: Miss Crawford’s letter stampt it a fact.', 'There was\r\nno second letter to explain away the first from Miss Crawford; there\r\nwas no intelligence from Mansfield, though it was now full time for her\r\nto hear again from her aunt.', 'He was aware of what Edmund must be suffering on his own behalf, in\r\naddition to all the rest, when they were in town: he had seen or\r\nconjectured his feelings; and, having reason to think that one\r\ninterview with Miss Crawford had taken place, from which Edmund derived\r\nonly increased distress, had been as anxious on that account as on\r\nothers to get him out of town, and had engaged him in taking Fanny home\r\nto her aunt, with a view to his relief and benefit, no less than\r\ntheirs.', 'Fanny was not in the secret of her uncle’s feelings, Sir Thomas\r\nnot in the secret of Miss Crawford’s character.', 'That Edmund must be for ever divided from Miss Crawford did not admit\r\nof a doubt with Fanny; and yet, till she knew that he felt the same,\r\nher own conviction was insufficient.', 'Long, long would it be ere Miss Crawford’s name passed his lips again,\r\nor she could hope for a renewal of such confidential intercourse as had\r\nbeen.', 'He had seen Miss Crawford.', 'That\r\nthe manner in which she treated the dreadful crime committed by her\r\nbrother and my sister (with whom lay the greater seduction I pretended\r\nnot to say), but the manner in which she spoke of the crime itself,\r\ngiving it every reproach but the right; considering its ill\r\nconsequences only as they were to be braved or overborne by a defiance\r\nof decency and impudence in wrong; and last of all, and above all,\r\nrecommending to us a compliance, a compromise, an acquiescence in the\r\ncontinuance of the sin, on the chance of a marriage which, thinking as\r\nI now thought of her brother, should rather be prevented than sought;\r\nall this together most grievously convinced me that I had never\r\nunderstood her before, and that, as far as related to mind, it had been\r\nthe creature of my own imagination, not Miss Crawford, that I had been\r\ntoo apt to dwell on for many months past.', 'Till that\r\nhappened, they continued to talk of Miss Crawford alone, and how she\r\nhad attached him, and how delightful nature had made her, and how\r\nexcellent she would have been, had she fallen into good hands earlier.', 'I only entreat everybody to believe that\r\nexactly at the time when it was quite natural that it should be so, and\r\nnot a week earlier, Edmund did cease to care about Miss Crawford, and\r\nbecame as anxious to marry Fanny as Fanny herself could desire.']

Il nome ' Mr. Crawford ' appare in queste frasi:
['Crawford must\r\ntake care of himself.” Mr. Crawford did not mean to be in any danger!', 'It delighted Mrs. Grant to keep them\r\nboth with her, and Dr. Grant was exceedingly well contented to have it\r\nso: a talking pretty young woman like Miss Crawford is always pleasant\r\nsociety to an indolent, stay-at-home man; and Mr. Crawford’s being his\r\nguest was an excuse for drinking claret every day.', 'The Miss Bertrams’ admiration of Mr. Crawford was more rapturous than\r\nanything which Miss Crawford’s habits made her likely to feel.', 'In a quiet way,\r\nvery little attended to, she paid her tribute of admiration to Miss\r\nCrawford’s beauty; but as she still continued to think Mr. Crawford\r\nvery plain, in spite of her two cousins having repeatedly proved the\r\ncontrary, she never mentioned _him_.', 'Instead of envying Mr.\r\nRushworth, you should assist him with your opinion.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Grant, hearing the latter part of this speech, enforced it warmly,\r\npersuaded that no judgment could be equal to her brother’s; and as Miss\r\nBertram caught at the idea likewise, and gave it her full support,\r\ndeclaring that, in her opinion, it was infinitely better to consult\r\nwith friends and disinterested advisers, than immediately to throw the\r\nbusiness into the hands of a professional man, Mr. Rushworth was very\r\nready to request the favour of Mr. Crawford’s assistance; and Mr.\r\nCrawford, after properly depreciating his own abilities, was quite at\r\nhis service in any way that could be useful.', 'Mr. Rushworth then began\r\nto propose Mr. Crawford’s doing him the honour of coming over to\r\nSotherton, and taking a bed there; when Mrs. Norris, as if reading in\r\nher two nieces’ minds their little approbation of a plan which was to\r\ntake Mr. Crawford away, interposed with an amendment.', '“There can be no doubt of Mr. Crawford’s willingness; but why should\r\nnot more of us go?', 'Here are many\r\nthat would be interested in your improvements, my dear Mr. Rushworth,\r\nand that would like to hear Mr. Crawford’s opinion on the spot, and\r\nthat might be of some small use to you with _their_ opinions; and, for\r\nmy own part, I have been long wishing to wait upon your good mother\r\nagain; nothing but having no horses of my own could have made me so\r\nremiss; but now I could go and sit a few hours with Mrs. Rushworth,\r\nwhile the rest of you walked about and settled things, and then we\r\ncould all return to a late dinner here, or dine at Sotherton, just as\r\nmight be most agreeable to your mother, and have a pleasant drive home\r\nby moonlight.', 'I dare say Mr. Crawford would take my two nieces and me\r\nin his barouche, and Edmund can go on horseback, you know, sister, and\r\nFanny will stay at home with you.”\r\n\r\nLady Bertram made no objection; and every one concerned in the going\r\nwas forward in expressing their ready concurrence, excepting Edmund,\r\nwho heard it all and said nothing.', 'Fanny could not wonder that Edmund was at the Parsonage every morning;\r\nshe would gladly have been there too, might she have gone in uninvited\r\nand unnoticed, to hear the harp; neither could she wonder that, when\r\nthe evening stroll was over, and the two families parted again, he\r\nshould think it right to attend Mrs. Grant and her sister to their\r\nhome, while Mr. Crawford was devoted to the ladies of the Park; but she\r\nthought it a very bad exchange; and if Edmund were not there to mix the\r\nwine and water for her, would rather go without it than not.', 'The houses, though scarcely half a mile apart, were not within sight of\r\neach other; but, by walking fifty yards from the hall door, she could\r\nlook down the park, and command a view of the Parsonage and all its\r\ndemesnes, gently rising beyond the village road; and in Dr. Grant’s\r\nmeadow she immediately saw the group—Edmund and Miss Crawford both on\r\nhorse-back, riding side by side, Dr. and Mrs. Grant, and Mr. Crawford,\r\nwith two or three grooms, standing about and looking on.', 'She\r\ncould not but think, indeed, that Mr. Crawford might as well have saved\r\nhim the trouble; that it would have been particularly proper and\r\nbecoming in a brother to have done it himself; but Mr. Crawford, with\r\nall his boasted good-nature, and all his coachmanship, probably knew\r\nnothing of the matter, and had no active kindness in comparison of\r\nEdmund.', 'Mrs. Norris and her nieces\r\nwere all well pleased with its revival, and an early day was named and\r\nagreed to, provided Mr. Crawford should be disengaged: the young ladies\r\ndid not forget that stipulation, and though Mrs. Norris would willingly\r\nhave answered for his being so, they would neither authorise the\r\nliberty nor run the risk; and at last, on a hint from Miss Bertram, Mr.\r\nRushworth discovered that the properest thing to be done was for him to\r\nwalk down to the Parsonage directly, and call on Mr. Crawford, and\r\ninquire whether Wednesday would suit him or not.', 'No, my dear Edmund, that\r\nwill not quite do.”\r\n\r\n“Besides,” said Maria, “I know that Mr. Crawford depends upon taking\r\nus.', 'After what passed at first, he would claim it as a promise.”\r\n\r\n“And, my dear Edmund,” added Mrs. Norris, “taking out _two_ carriages\r\nwhen _one_ will do, would be trouble for nothing; and, between\r\nourselves, coachman is not very fond of the roads between this and\r\nSotherton: he always complains bitterly of the narrow lanes scratching\r\nhis carriage, and you know one should not like to have dear Sir Thomas,\r\nwhen he comes home, find all the varnish scratched off.”\r\n\r\n“That would not be a very handsome reason for using Mr. Crawford’s,”\r\nsaid Maria; “but the truth is, that Wilcox is a stupid old fellow, and\r\ndoes not know how to drive.', 'For the first seven miles Miss Bertram had very little real comfort:\r\nher prospect always ended in Mr. Crawford and her sister sitting side\r\nby side, full of conversation and merriment; and to see only his\r\nexpressive profile as he turned with a smile to Julia, or to catch the\r\nlaugh of the other, was a perpetual source of irritation, which her own\r\nsense of propriety could but just smooth over.', 'Mrs. Rushworth was gone to repeat her lesson to Mr. Crawford; and\r\nEdmund, Fanny, and Miss Crawford remained in a cluster together.', 'One\r\nwishes it were not so; but I have not yet left Oxford long enough to\r\nforget what chapel prayers are.”\r\n\r\nWhile this was passing, the rest of the party being scattered about the\r\nchapel, Julia called Mr. Crawford’s attention to her sister, by saying,\r\n“Do look at Mr. Rushworth and Maria, standing side by side, exactly as\r\nif the ceremony were going to be performed.', '“Here are the greatest\r\nnumber of our plants, and here are the curious pheasants.”\r\n\r\n“Query,” said Mr. Crawford, looking round him, “whether we may not find\r\nsomething to employ us here before we go farther?', 'She listened, and at length she heard; she heard voices and feet\r\napproaching; but she had just satisfied herself that it was not those\r\nshe wanted, when Miss Bertram, Mr. Rushworth, and Mr. Crawford issued\r\nfrom the same path which she had trod herself, and were before her.', '“It is undoubtedly the best thing we can do now, as we are so far from\r\nthe house already,” said Mr. Crawford, when he was gone.', 'You had better\r\nnot go.”\r\n\r\nHer cousin was safe on the other side while these words were spoken,\r\nand, smiling with all the good-humour of success, she said, “Thank you,\r\nmy dear Fanny, but I and my gown are alive and well, and so good-bye.”\r\n\r\nFanny was again left to her solitude, and with no increase of pleasant\r\nfeelings, for she was sorry for almost all that she had seen and heard,\r\nastonished at Miss Bertram, and angry with Mr. Crawford.', 'I thought Maria and Mr. Crawford were with you.”\r\n\r\nFanny explained.', 'At the same moment Mr. Crawford, approaching Julia, said, “I hope\r\nI am not to lose my companion, unless she is afraid of the evening air\r\nin so exposed a seat.” The request had not been foreseen, but was very\r\ngraciously received, and Julia’s day was likely to end almost as well\r\nas it began.', 'Maria, with only Mr. Rushworth to attend to her, and doomed to the\r\nrepeated details of his day’s sport, good or bad, his boast of his\r\ndogs, his jealousy of his neighbours, his doubts of their\r\nqualifications, and his zeal after poachers, subjects which will not\r\nfind their way to female feelings without some talent on one side or\r\nsome attachment on the other, had missed Mr. Crawford grievously; and\r\nJulia, unengaged and unemployed, felt all the right of missing him much\r\nmore.', 'Julia might be\r\njustified in so doing by the hints of Mrs. Grant, inclined to credit\r\nwhat she wished, and Maria by the hints of Mr. Crawford himself.', 'Fanny was the only one of the party who found anything to dislike; but\r\nsince the day at Sotherton, she could never see Mr. Crawford with\r\neither sister without observation, and seldom without wonder or\r\ncensure; and had her confidence in her own judgment been equal to her\r\nexercise of it in every other respect, had she been sure that she was\r\nseeing clearly, and judging candidly, she would probably have made some\r\nimportant communications to her usual confidant.', '“I am rather\r\nsurprised,” said she, “that Mr. Crawford should come back again so\r\nsoon, after being here so long before, full seven weeks; for I had\r\nunderstood he was so very fond of change and moving about, that I\r\nthought something would certainly occur, when he was once gone, to take\r\nhim elsewhere.', 'Crawford has too much sense to stay here if he found\r\nhimself in any danger from Maria; and I am not at all afraid for her,\r\nafter such a proof as she has given that her feelings are not strong.”\r\n\r\nFanny supposed she must have been mistaken, and meant to think\r\ndifferently in future; but with all that submission to Edmund could do,\r\nand all the help of the coinciding looks and hints which she\r\noccasionally noticed in some of the others, and which seemed to say\r\nthat Julia was Mr. Crawford’s choice, she knew not always what to\r\nthink.', 'Dear ma’am, only look at her face at this\r\nmoment; how different from what it was the two last dances!”\r\n\r\nMiss Bertram did indeed look happy, her eyes were sparkling with\r\npleasure, and she was speaking with great animation, for Julia and her\r\npartner, Mr. Crawford, were close to her; they were all in a cluster\r\ntogether.', 'Miss Julia and Mr. Crawford.', 'Amelia and Agatha may do for Maria and me, but here is\r\nnothing for your sister, Mr. Crawford.”\r\n\r\nMr. Crawford desired _that_ might not be thought of: he was very sure\r\nhis sister had no wish of acting but as she might be useful, and that\r\nshe would not allow herself to be considered in the present case.', 'Her\r\nentreaty had no effect on Tom: he only said again what he had said\r\nbefore; and it was not merely Tom, for the requisition was now backed\r\nby Maria, and Mr. Crawford, and Mr. Yates, with an urgency which\r\ndiffered from his but in being more gentle or more ceremonious, and\r\nwhich altogether was quite overpowering to Fanny; and before she could\r\nbreathe after it, Mrs. Norris completed the whole by thus addressing\r\nher in a whisper at once angry and audible—“What a piece of work here\r\nis about nothing: I am quite ashamed of you, Fanny, to make such a\r\ndifficulty of obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort—so kind as\r\nthey are to you!', 'She knew, also, that\r\npoor Mr. Rushworth could seldom get anybody to rehearse with him: _his_\r\ncomplaint came before her as well as the rest; and so decided to her\r\neye was her cousin Maria’s avoidance of him, and so needlessly often\r\nthe rehearsal of the first scene between her and Mr. Crawford, that she\r\nhad soon all the terror of other complaints from _him_.', 'As far as she could judge, Mr. Crawford was considerably the best actor\r\nof all: he had more confidence than Edmund, more judgment than Tom,\r\nmore talent and taste than Mr. Yates.', 'Sir Thomas had been\r\nquite indifferent to Mr. Crawford’s going or staying: but his good\r\nwishes for Mr. Yates’s having a pleasant journey, as he walked with him\r\nto the hall-door, were given with genuine satisfaction.', 'In the drawing-room Mr. Crawford certainly was, having been just long\r\nenough arrived to be ready for dinner; and the smiles and pleased looks\r\nof the three others standing round him, shewed how welcome was his\r\nsudden resolution of coming to them for a few days on leaving Bath.', 'She was soon aware of this herself; for\r\nthough she must submit, as her own propriety of mind directed, in spite\r\nof her aunt Norris’s opinion, to being the principal lady in company,\r\nand to all the little distinctions consequent thereon, she found, while\r\nthey were at table, such a happy flow of conversation prevailing, in\r\nwhich she was not required to take any part—there was so much to be\r\nsaid between the brother and sister about Bath, so much between the two\r\nyoung men about hunting, so much of politics between Mr. Crawford and\r\nDr. Grant, and of everything and all together between Mr. Crawford and\r\nMrs. Grant, as to leave her the fairest prospect of having only to\r\nlisten in quiet, and of passing a very agreeable day.', 'She feared for William; by no means convinced by\r\nall that he could relate of his own horsemanship in various countries,\r\nof the scrambling parties in which he had been engaged, the rough\r\nhorses and mules he had ridden, or his many narrow escapes from\r\ndreadful falls, that he was at all equal to the management of a\r\nhigh-fed hunter in an English fox-chase; nor till he returned safe and\r\nwell, without accident or discredit, could she be reconciled to the\r\nrisk, or feel any of that obligation to Mr. Crawford for lending the\r\nhorse which he had fully intended it should produce.', 'His mind, now disengaged from\r\nthe cares which had pressed on him at first, was at leisure to find the\r\nGrants and their young inmates really worth visiting; and though\r\ninfinitely above scheming or contriving for any the most advantageous\r\nmatrimonial establishment that could be among the apparent\r\npossibilities of any one most dear to him, and disdaining even as a\r\nlittleness the being quick-sighted on such points, he could not avoid\r\nperceiving, in a grand and careless way, that Mr. Crawford was somewhat\r\ndistinguishing his niece—nor perhaps refrain (though unconsciously)\r\nfrom giving a more willing assent to invitations on that account.', 'I am never to see my cards; and Mr. Crawford does\r\nall the rest.”\r\n\r\n“Bertram,” said Crawford, some time afterwards, taking the opportunity\r\nof a little languor in the game, “I have never told you what happened\r\nto me yesterday in my ride home.” They had been hunting together, and\r\nwere in the midst of a good run, and at some distance from Mansfield,\r\nwhen his horse being found to have flung a shoe, Henry Crawford had\r\nbeen obliged to give up, and make the best of his way back.', 'As yet Sir Thomas had seen nothing to remark in Mr. Crawford’s\r\nbehaviour; but when the whist-table broke up at the end of the second\r\nrubber, and leaving Dr. Grant and Mrs. Norris to dispute over their\r\nlast play, he became a looker-on at the other, he found his niece the\r\nobject of attentions, or rather of professions, of a somewhat pointed\r\ncharacter.', 'It is perfectly natural that you should not have\r\nthought much on the subject, Mr. Crawford.', 'Fanny’s last feeling in the visit was disappointment: for the shawl\r\nwhich Edmund was quietly taking from the servant to bring and put round\r\nher shoulders was seized by Mr. Crawford’s quicker hand, and she was\r\nobliged to be indebted to his more prominent attention.', 'Thursday was the day of the ball; and on Wednesday morning Fanny, still\r\nunable to satisfy herself as to what she ought to wear, determined to\r\nseek the counsel of the more enlightened, and apply to Mrs. Grant and\r\nher sister, whose acknowledged taste would certainly bear her\r\nblameless; and as Edmund and William were gone to Northampton, and she\r\nhad reason to think Mr. Crawford likewise out, she walked down to the\r\nParsonage without much fear of wanting an opportunity for private\r\ndiscussion; and the privacy of such a discussion was a most important\r\npart of it to Fanny, being more than half-ashamed of her own\r\nsolicitude.', 'It was impossible for her to be insensible of Mr. Crawford’s change of\r\nmanners.', 'Thursday, predestined to hope and enjoyment, came; and opened with more\r\nkindness to Fanny than such self-willed, unmanageable days often\r\nvolunteer, for soon after breakfast a very friendly note was brought\r\nfrom Mr. Crawford to William, stating that as he found himself obliged\r\nto go to London on the morrow for a few days, he could not help trying\r\nto procure a companion; and therefore hoped that if William could make\r\nup his mind to leave Mansfield half a day earlier than had been\r\nproposed, he would accept a place in his carriage.', 'The proposal was a very\r\npleasant one to William himself, who enjoyed the idea of travelling\r\npost with four horses, and such a good-humoured, agreeable friend; and,\r\nin likening it to going up with despatches, was saying at once\r\neverything in favour of its happiness and dignity which his imagination\r\ncould suggest; and Fanny, from a different motive, was exceedingly\r\npleased; for the original plan was that William should go up by the\r\nmail from Northampton the following night, which would not have allowed\r\nhim an hour’s rest before he must have got into a Portsmouth coach; and\r\nthough this offer of Mr. Crawford’s would rob her of many hours of his\r\ncompany, she was too happy in having William spared from the fatigue of\r\nsuch a journey, to think of anything else.', 'Since the first joy from Mr. Crawford’s note to William had worn\r\naway, she had been in a state absolutely the reverse; there had been no\r\ncomfort around, no hope within her.', 'Her own musings were\r\nbrought to an end on perceiving Mr. Crawford before her, and her\r\nthoughts were put into another channel by his engaging her almost\r\ninstantly for the first two dances.', 'To be secure of a partner at\r\nfirst was a most essential good—for the moment of beginning was now\r\ngrowing seriously near; and she so little understood her own claims as\r\nto think that if Mr. Crawford had not asked her, she must have been the\r\nlast to be sought after, and should have received a partner only\r\nthrough a series of inquiry, and bustle, and interference, which would\r\nhave been terrible; but at the same time there was a pointedness in his\r\nmanner of asking her which she did not like, and she saw his eye\r\nglancing for a moment at her necklace, with a smile—she thought there\r\nwas a smile—which made her blush and feel wretched.', 'In a few minutes Sir Thomas came to her, and asked if she were engaged;\r\nand the “Yes, sir; to Mr. Crawford,” was exactly what he had intended\r\nto hear.', 'And to\r\nhave them away when it was given—and for _her_ to be opening the\r\nball—and with Mr. Crawford too!', 'She was attractive, she was modest, she was Sir\r\nThomas’s niece, and she was soon said to be admired by Mr. Crawford.', 'From that time Mr. Crawford sat down likewise.', '“Advise” was his\r\nword, but it was the advice of absolute power, and she had only to\r\nrise, and, with Mr. Crawford’s very cordial adieus, pass quietly away;\r\nstopping at the entrance-door, like the Lady of Branxholm Hall, “one\r\nmoment and no more,” to view the happy scene, and take a last look at\r\nthe five or six determined couple who were still hard at work; and\r\nthen, creeping slowly up the principal staircase, pursued by the\r\nceaseless country-dance, feverish with hopes and fears, soup and negus,\r\nsore-footed and fatigued, restless and agitated, yet feeling, in spite\r\nof everything, that a ball was indeed delightful.', 'It might occur to him that Mr. Crawford had been\r\nsitting by her long enough, or he might mean to recommend her as a wife\r\nby shewing her persuadableness.', 'After seeing William to the last moment, Fanny walked back to the\r\nbreakfast-room with a very saddened heart to grieve over the melancholy\r\nchange; and there her uncle kindly left her to cry in peace,\r\nconceiving, perhaps, that the deserted chair of each young man might\r\nexercise her tender enthusiasm, and that the remaining cold pork bones\r\nand mustard in William’s plate might but divide her feelings with the\r\nbroken egg-shells in Mr. Crawford’s.', '“She could not recollect what it\r\nwas that she had heard about one of the Miss Maddoxes, or what it was\r\nthat Lady Prescott had noticed in Fanny: she was not sure whether\r\nColonel Harrison had been talking of Mr. Crawford or of William when he\r\nsaid he was the finest young man in the room—somebody had whispered\r\nsomething to her; she had forgot to ask Sir Thomas what it could be.”\r\nAnd these were her longest speeches and clearest communications: the\r\nrest was only a languid “Yes, yes; very well; did you?', 'Oh, Mr. Crawford, we are\r\ninfinitely obliged to you!', 'While her heart was still bounding with joy\r\nand gratitude on William’s behalf, she could not be severely resentful\r\nof anything that injured only herself; and after having twice drawn\r\nback her hand, and twice attempted in vain to turn away from him, she\r\ngot up, and said only, with much agitation, “Don’t, Mr. Crawford, pray\r\ndon’t!', 'She would not stir farther from the East room than the head of the\r\ngreat staircase, till she had satisfied herself of Mr. Crawford’s\r\nhaving left the house; but when convinced of his being gone, she was\r\neager to go down and be with her uncle, and have all the happiness of\r\nhis joy as well as her own, and all the benefit of his information or\r\nhis conjectures as to what would now be William’s destination.', 'Sir\r\nThomas was as joyful as she could desire, and very kind and\r\ncommunicative; and she had so comfortable a talk with him about William\r\nas to make her feel as if nothing had occurred to vex her, till she\r\nfound, towards the close, that Mr. Crawford was engaged to return and\r\ndine there that very day.', 'She was distressed whenever Mr. Crawford spoke to her, and\r\nhe spoke to her much too often; and she was afraid there was a\r\nsomething in his voice and manner in addressing her very different from\r\nwhat they were when he talked to the others.', 'Her comfort in that day’s\r\ndinner was quite destroyed: she could hardly eat anything; and when Sir\r\nThomas good-humouredly observed that joy had taken away her appetite,\r\nshe was ready to sink with shame, from the dread of Mr. Crawford’s\r\ninterpretation; for though nothing could have tempted her to turn her\r\neyes to the right hand, where he sat, she felt that _his_ were\r\nimmediately directed towards her.', 'She had quite convinced herself of this before Sir Thomas\r\nand Mr. Crawford joined them.', 'The difficulty was in maintaining the\r\nconviction quite so absolutely after Mr. Crawford was in the room; for\r\nonce or twice a look seemed forced on her which she did not know how to\r\nclass among the common meaning; in any other man, at least, she would\r\nhave said that it meant something very earnest, very pointed.', 'I have seen too much of Mr. Crawford not to understand his\r\nmanners; if he understood me as well, he would, I dare say, behave\r\ndifferently.', 'With thanks for the honour\r\nof your note,\r\n\r\n\r\nI remain, dear Miss Crawford,\r\n&c., &c.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conclusion was scarcely intelligible from increasing fright, for\r\nshe found that Mr. Crawford, under pretence of receiving the note, was\r\ncoming towards her.', 'She had\r\nno doubt that her note must appear excessively ill-written, that the\r\nlanguage would disgrace a child, for her distress had allowed no\r\narrangement; but at least it would assure them both of her being\r\nneither imposed on nor gratified by Mr. Crawford’s attentions.', 'CHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nFanny had by no means forgotten Mr. Crawford when she awoke the next\r\nmorning; but she remembered the purport of her note, and was not less\r\nsanguine as to its effect than she had been the night before.', 'Having so satisfactorily settled the conviction her note would convey,\r\nshe could not but be astonished to see Mr. Crawford, as she\r\naccidentally did, coming up to the house again, and at an hour as early\r\nas the day before.', 'She sat some time in a good deal of agitation, listening, trembling,\r\nand fearing to be sent for every moment; but as no footsteps approached\r\nthe East room, she grew gradually composed, could sit down, and be able\r\nto employ herself, and able to hope that Mr. Crawford had come and\r\nwould go without her being obliged to know anything of the matter.', 'I\r\nhad not been long in my own room, after breakfast, when Mr. Crawford\r\nwas shewn in.', 'His errand you may probably conjecture.”\r\n\r\nFanny’s colour grew deeper and deeper; and her uncle, perceiving that\r\nshe was embarrassed to a degree that made either speaking or looking up\r\nquite impossible, turned away his own eyes, and without any farther\r\npause proceeded in his account of Mr. Crawford’s visit.', 'How could Mr. Crawford say such a thing?', '“Am I to understand,” said Sir Thomas, after a few moments’ silence,\r\n“that you mean to _refuse_ Mr. Crawford?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Refuse him?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Refuse Mr. Crawford!', 'He has done it already.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Fanny, in a faint voice, and looking down with fresh shame;\r\nand she did feel almost ashamed of herself, after such a picture as her\r\nuncle had drawn, for not liking Mr. Crawford.', '“You must have been aware,” continued Sir Thomas presently, “you must\r\nhave been some time aware of a particularity in Mr. Crawford’s manners\r\nto you.', '“Independently of the interest which Mr. Crawford’s _choice_ seemed to\r\njustify” said Sir Thomas, beginning again, and very composedly, “his\r\nwishing to marry at all so early is recommendatory to me.', 'But the removal of his alarm did his niece no\r\nservice: as her unaccountableness was confirmed his displeasure\r\nincreased; and getting up and walking about the room with a frown,\r\nwhich Fanny could picture to herself, though she dared not lift up her\r\neyes, he shortly afterwards, and in a voice of authority, said, “Have\r\nyou any reason, child, to think ill of Mr. Crawford’s temper?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir.”\r\n\r\nShe longed to add, “But of his principles I have”; but her heart sunk\r\nunder the appalling prospect of discussion, explanation, and probably\r\nnon-conviction.', 'Maria and Julia, and especially Maria, were so\r\nclosely implicated in Mr. Crawford’s misconduct, that she could not\r\ngive his character, such as she believed it, without betraying them.', 'You think only of yourself, and because\r\nyou do not feel for Mr. Crawford exactly what a young heated fancy\r\nimagines to be necessary for happiness, you resolve to refuse him at\r\nonce, without wishing even for a little time to consider of it, a\r\nlittle more time for cool consideration, and for really examining your\r\nown inclinations; and are, in a wild fit of folly, throwing away from\r\nyou such an opportunity of being settled in life, eligibly, honourably,\r\nnobly settled, as will, probably, never occur to you again.', 'Here is a\r\nyoung man of sense, of character, of temper, of manners, and of\r\nfortune, exceedingly attached to you, and seeking your hand in the most\r\nhandsome and disinterested way; and let me tell you, Fanny, that you\r\nmay live eighteen years longer in the world without being addressed by\r\na man of half Mr. Crawford’s estate, or a tenth part of his merits.', 'Maria\r\nis nobly married; but had Mr. Crawford sought Julia’s hand, I should\r\nhave given it to him with superior and more heartfelt satisfaction than\r\nI gave Maria’s to Mr. Rushworth.” After half a moment’s pause: “And I\r\nshould have been very much surprised had either of my daughters, on\r\nreceiving a proposal of marriage at any time which might carry with it\r\nonly _half_ the eligibility of _this_, immediately and peremptorily,\r\nand without paying my opinion or my regard the compliment of any\r\nconsultation, put a decided negative on it.', 'She\r\ncould not but feel some resentment against Mr. Crawford; yet, if he\r\nreally loved her, and were unhappy too!', 'When the meeting with which she was threatened for the morrow was past,\r\nshe could not but flatter herself that the subject would be finally\r\nconcluded, and Mr. Crawford once gone from Mansfield, that everything\r\nwould soon be as if no such subject had existed.', 'She would not, could\r\nnot believe, that Mr. Crawford’s affection for her could distress him\r\nlong; his mind was not of that sort.', '“No, ma’am, it is Miss Price; I am certain of\r\nits being Miss Price.” And there was a half-smile with the words, which\r\nmeant, “I do not think you would answer the purpose at all.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris, much discontented, was obliged to compose herself to work\r\nagain; and Fanny, walking off in agitating consciousness, found\r\nherself, as she anticipated, in another minute alone with Mr. Crawford.', 'Mr. Crawford was no longer the Mr. Crawford who, as\r\nthe clandestine, insidious, treacherous admirer of Maria Bertram, had\r\nbeen her abhorrence, whom she had hated to see or to speak to, in whom\r\nshe could believe no good quality to exist, and whose power, even of\r\nbeing agreeable, she had barely acknowledged.', 'He was now the Mr.\r\nCrawford who was addressing herself with ardent, disinterested love;\r\nwhose feelings were apparently become all that was honourable and\r\nupright, whose views of happiness were all fixed on a marriage of\r\nattachment; who was pouring out his sense of her merits, describing and\r\ndescribing again his affection, proving as far as words could prove it,\r\nand in the language, tone, and spirit of a man of talent too, that he\r\nsought her for her gentleness and her goodness; and to complete the\r\nwhole, he was now the Mr. Crawford who had procured William’s\r\npromotion!', 'Here was\r\nagain a something of the same Mr. Crawford whom she had so reprobated\r\nbefore.', 'So thought Fanny, in good truth and sober sadness, as she sat musing\r\nover that too great indulgence and luxury of a fire upstairs: wondering\r\nat the past and present; wondering at what was yet to come, and in a\r\nnervous agitation which made nothing clear to her but the persuasion of\r\nher being never under any circumstances able to love Mr. Crawford, and\r\nthe felicity of having a fire to sit over and think of it.', 'At Mansfield Park Mr. Crawford would always be welcome; he\r\nhad only to consult his own judgment and feelings as to the frequency\r\nof his visits, at present or in future.', 'Had his choice been less unexceptionable, I should\r\nhave condemned his persevering.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, sir,” said Fanny, “I am very sorry that Mr. Crawford should\r\ncontinue to—I know that it is paying me a very great compliment, and I\r\nfeel most undeservedly honoured; but I am so perfectly convinced, and I\r\nhave told him so, that it never will be in my power—”\r\n\r\n“My dear,” interrupted Sir Thomas, “there is no occasion for this.', 'Your happiness and\r\nadvantage are all that I have in view, and nothing is required of you\r\nbut to bear with Mr. Crawford’s endeavours to convince you that they\r\nmay not be incompatible with his.', 'She could not, though only eighteen, suppose Mr. Crawford’s attachment\r\nwould hold out for ever; she could not but imagine that steady,\r\nunceasing discouragement from herself would put an end to it in time.', 'In spite of his intended silence, Sir Thomas found himself once more\r\nobliged to mention the subject to his niece, to prepare her briefly for\r\nits being imparted to her aunts; a measure which he would still have\r\navoided, if possible, but which became necessary from the totally\r\nopposite feelings of Mr. Crawford as to any secrecy of proceeding.', 'It was an injury and affront to\r\nJulia, who ought to have been Mr. Crawford’s choice; and, independently\r\nof that, she disliked Fanny, because she had neglected her; and she\r\nwould have grudged such an elevation to one whom she had been always\r\ntrying to depress.', 'I could do very well without you, if you were\r\nmarried to a man of such good estate as Mr. Crawford.', 'To _good_ reading, however, she had\r\nbeen long used: her uncle read well, her cousins all, Edmund very well,\r\nbut in Mr. Crawford’s reading there was a variety of excellence beyond\r\nwhat she had ever met with.', '“You have a great turn for acting, I am sure, Mr. Crawford,” said her\r\nladyship soon afterwards; “and I will tell you what, I think you will\r\nhave a theatre, some time or other, at your house in Norfolk.', 'And I do not know that I should be fond of\r\npreaching often; now and then, perhaps once or twice in the spring,\r\nafter being anxiously expected for half a dozen Sundays together; but\r\nnot for a constancy; it would not do for a constancy.”\r\n\r\nHere Fanny, who could not but listen, involuntarily shook her head, and\r\nCrawford was instantly by her side again, entreating to know her\r\nmeaning; and as Edmund perceived, by his drawing in a chair, and\r\nsitting down close by her, that it was to be a very thorough attack,\r\nthat looks and undertones were to be well tried, he sank as quietly as\r\npossible into a corner, turned his back, and took up a newspaper, very\r\nsincerely wishing that dear little Fanny might be persuaded into\r\nexplaining away that shake of the head to the satisfaction of her\r\nardent lover; and as earnestly trying to bury every sound of the\r\nbusiness from himself in murmurs of his own, over the various\r\nadvertisements of “A most desirable Estate in South Wales”; “To Parents\r\nand Guardians”; and a “Capital season’d Hunter.”\r\n\r\nFanny, meanwhile, vexed with herself for not having been as motionless\r\nas she was speechless, and grieved to the heart to see Edmund’s\r\narrangements, was trying by everything in the power of her modest,\r\ngentle nature, to repulse Mr. Crawford, and avoid both his looks and\r\ninquiries; and he, unrepulsable, was persisting in both.', 'What did that shake of the head mean?”\r\n\r\nIn vain was her “Pray, sir, don’t; pray, Mr. Crawford,” repeated twice\r\nover; and in vain did she try to move away.', 'After leaving him to his happier thoughts for some minutes, Fanny,\r\nfeeling it due to herself, returned to Mr. Crawford, and said, “It is\r\nnot merely in _temper_ that I consider him as totally unsuited to\r\nmyself; though, in _that_ respect, I think the difference between us\r\ntoo great, infinitely too great: his spirits often oppress me; but\r\nthere is something in him which I object to still more.', 'But, even supposing it is so, allowing Mr. Crawford to\r\nhave all the claims which his sisters think he has, how was I to be\r\nprepared to meet him with any feeling answerable to his own?', 'In my\r\nsituation, it would have been the extreme of vanity to be forming\r\nexpectations on Mr. Crawford.', 'I could not but see that Mr. Crawford amused himself\r\nin gallantries which did mean nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!', 'Fanny’s immediate concerns, as far as they involved Mr. Crawford, made\r\nno part of their conversation.', 'She had reason to suppose herself not yet forgotten by Mr. Crawford.', 'It was a gentleman’s voice; it was a voice that Fanny was just turning\r\npale about, when Mr. Crawford walked into the room.', 'They talked of William, a subject on which Mrs. Price could never tire;\r\nand Mr. Crawford was as warm in his commendation as even her heart\r\ncould wish.', '“Her daughters were very much confined; Portsmouth was a sad place;\r\nthey did not often get out; and she knew they had some errands in the\r\ntown, which they would be very glad to do.” And the consequence was,\r\nthat Fanny, strange as it was—strange, awkward, and distressing—found\r\nherself and Susan, within ten minutes, walking towards the High Street\r\nwith Mr. Crawford.', 'Such was his\r\ninstinctive compliment to the good manners of Mr. Crawford; and, be the\r\nconsequence what it might, Fanny’s immediate feelings were infinitely\r\nsoothed.', 'The conclusion of the two gentlemen’s civilities was an offer of Mr.\r\nPrice’s to take Mr. Crawford into the dockyard, which Mr. Crawford,\r\ndesirous of accepting as a favour what was intended as such, though he\r\nhad seen the dockyard again and again, and hoping to be so much the\r\nlonger with Fanny, was very gratefully disposed to avail himself of, if\r\nthe Miss Prices were not afraid of the fatigue; and as it was somehow\r\nor other ascertained, or inferred, or at least acted upon, that they\r\nwere not at all afraid, to the dockyard they were all to go; and but\r\nfor Mr. Crawford, Mr. Price would have turned thither directly, without\r\nthe smallest consideration for his daughters’ errands in the High\r\nStreet.', 'They were then to set forward for the dockyard at once, and the walk\r\nwould have been conducted—according to Mr. Crawford’s opinion—in a\r\nsingular manner, had Mr. Price been allowed the entire regulation of\r\nit, as the two girls, he found, would have been left to follow, and\r\nkeep up with them or not, as they could, while they walked on together\r\nat their own hasty pace.', 'When Mr. Price and his friend had seen all that they wished, or had\r\ntime for, the others were ready to return; and in the course of their\r\nwalk back, Mr. Crawford contrived a minute’s privacy for telling Fanny\r\nthat his only business in Portsmouth was to see her; that he was come\r\ndown for a couple of days on her account, and hers only, and because he\r\ncould not endure a longer total separation.', 'In chapel they were obliged to divide, but Mr. Crawford took care not\r\nto be divided from the female branch; and after chapel he still\r\ncontinued with them, and made one in the family party on the ramparts.', 'Thither they now went; Mr. Crawford most happy to consider the Miss\r\nPrices as his peculiar charge; and before they had been there long,\r\nsomehow or other, there was no saying how, Fanny could not have\r\nbelieved it, but he was walking between them with an arm of each under\r\nhis, and she did not know how to prevent or put an end to it.', 'It may not be convenient for me to be fetched\r\nexactly at the two months’ end.”\r\n\r\nAfter a moment’s reflection, Mr. Crawford replied, “I know Mansfield, I\r\nknow its way, I know its faults towards _you_.', 'Though tolerably\r\nsecure of not seeing Mr. Crawford again, she could not help being low.', 'CHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was presumed that Mr. Crawford was travelling back, to London, on\r\nthe morrow, for nothing more was seen of him at Mr. Price’s; and two\r\ndays afterwards, it was a fact ascertained to Fanny by the following\r\nletter from his sister, opened and read by her, on another account,\r\nwith the most anxious curiosity:—\r\n\r\n“I have to inform you, my dearest Fanny, that Henry has been down to\r\nPortsmouth to see you; that he had a delightful walk with you to the\r\ndockyard last Saturday, and one still more to be dwelt on the next day,\r\non the ramparts; when the balmy air, the sparkling sea, and your sweet\r\nlooks and conversation were altogether in the most delicious harmony,\r\nand afforded sensations which are to raise ecstasy even in retrospect.', 'If Mr. Crawford remembered her\r\nmessage to her cousin, she thought it very likely, most likely, that he\r\nwould write to her at all events; it would be most consistent with his\r\nusual kindness; and till she got rid of this idea, till it gradually\r\nwore off, by no letters appearing in the course of three or four days\r\nmore, she was in a most restless, anxious state.', 'And had it been possible\r\nfor her to return Mr. Crawford’s regard, the probability of his being\r\nvery far from objecting to such a measure would have been the greatest\r\nincrease of all her own comforts.', 'She could only perceive that it must relate to Wimpole Street\r\nand Mr. Crawford, and only conjecture that something very imprudent had\r\njust occurred in that quarter to draw the notice of the world, and to\r\nexcite her jealousy, in Miss Crawford’s apprehension, if she heard it.', 'As to Mr. Crawford, she hoped it might give him a knowledge of his own\r\ndisposition, convince him that he was not capable of being steadily\r\nattached to any one woman in the world, and shame him from persisting\r\nany longer in addressing herself.', 'It was not Mr. and\r\nMrs. Rushworth; it was Mrs. Rushworth and Mr. Crawford.', 'Had Fanny accepted Mr. Crawford this could not\r\nhave happened.', 'Mrs. Rushworth had gone, for the Easter holidays, to Twickenham, with a\r\nfamily whom she had just grown intimate with: a family of lively,\r\nagreeable manners, and probably of morals and discretion to suit, for\r\nto _their_ house Mr. Crawford had constant access at all times.', 'But had she been less\r\nobstinate, or of less weight with her son, who was always guided by the\r\nlast speaker, by the person who could get hold of and shut him up, the\r\ncase would still have been hopeless, for Mrs. Rushworth did not appear\r\nagain, and there was every reason to conclude her to be concealed\r\nsomewhere with Mr. Crawford, who had quitted his uncle’s house, as for\r\na journey, on the very day of her absenting herself.', 'She was returned to Mansfield Park, she was\r\nuseful, she was beloved; she was safe from Mr. Crawford; and when Sir\r\nThomas came back she had every proof that could be given in his then\r\nmelancholy state of spirits, of his perfect approbation and increased\r\nregard; and happy as all this must make her, she would still have been\r\nhappy without any of it, for Edmund was no longer the dupe of Miss\r\nCrawford.', 'She was not to be prevailed\r\non to leave Mr. Crawford.']

Il nome ' William ' appare in queste frasi:
['It was William whom she talked of most, and\r\nwanted most to see.', 'Would it make you happy to write to William?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, very.”\r\n\r\n“Then let it be done now.', 'Come with me into the breakfast-room, we\r\nshall find everything there, and be sure of having the room to\r\nourselves.”\r\n\r\n“But, cousin, will it go to the post?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, depend upon me it shall: it shall go with the other letters; and,\r\nas your uncle will frank it, it will cost William nothing.”\r\n\r\n“My uncle!” repeated Fanny, with a frightened look.', 'He wrote with his own hand his\r\nlove to his cousin William, and sent him half a guinea under the seal.', 'Of the rest she saw nothing: nobody seemed to think of her\r\never going amongst them again, even for a visit, nobody at home seemed\r\nto want her; but William determining, soon after her removal, to be a\r\nsailor, was invited to spend a week with his sister in Northamptonshire\r\nbefore he went to sea.', 'Luckily the visit happened in the Christmas\r\nholidays, when she could directly look for comfort to her cousin\r\nEdmund; and he told her such charming things of what William was to do,\r\nand be hereafter, in consequence of his profession, as made her\r\ngradually admit that the separation might have some use.', 'In\r\nreturn for such services she loved him better than anybody in the world\r\nexcept William: her heart was divided between the two.', 'it\r\nwas a shameful insensibility.” He had said to her, moreover, on the\r\nvery last morning, that he hoped she might see William again in the\r\ncourse of the ensuing winter, and had charged her to write and invite\r\nhim to Mansfield as soon as the squadron to which he belonged should be\r\nknown to be in England.', 'But he had ended his speech in a way to sink her in sad mortification,\r\nby adding, “If William does come to Mansfield, I hope you may be able\r\nto convince him that the many years which have passed since you parted\r\nhave not been spent on your side entirely without improvement; though,\r\nI fear, he must find his sister at sixteen in some respects too much\r\nlike his sister at ten.” She cried bitterly over this reflection when\r\nher uncle was gone; and her cousins, on seeing her with red eyes, set\r\nher down as a hypocrite.', 'Upon the whole, it was a comfortable winter to her;\r\nfor though it brought no William to England, the never-failing hope of\r\nhis arrival was worth much.', 'Yours sincerely.’ That is the true manly style;\r\nthat is a complete brother’s letter.”\r\n\r\n“When they are at a distance from all their family,” said Fanny,\r\ncolouring for William’s sake, “they can write long letters.”\r\n\r\n“Miss Price has a brother at sea,” said Edmund, “whose excellence as a\r\ncorrespondent makes her think you too severe upon us.”\r\n\r\n“At sea, has she?', 'Your uncle, and his brother admirals,\r\nperhaps knew little of clergymen beyond the chaplains whom, good or\r\nbad, they were always wishing away.”\r\n\r\n“Poor William!', 'The room was most dear to her, and she would not have changed its\r\nfurniture for the handsomest in the house, though what had been\r\noriginally plain had suffered all the ill-usage of children; and its\r\ngreatest elegancies and ornaments were a faded footstool of Julia’s\r\nwork, too ill done for the drawing-room, three transparencies, made in\r\na rage for transparencies, for the three lower panes of one window,\r\nwhere Tintern Abbey held its station between a cave in Italy and a\r\nmoonlight lake in Cumberland, a collection of family profiles, thought\r\nunworthy of being anywhere else, over the mantelpiece, and by their\r\nside, and pinned against the wall, a small sketch of a ship sent four\r\nyears ago from the Mediterranean by William, with H.M.S.', 'He inquired next\r\nafter her family, especially William: and his kindness altogether was\r\nsuch as made her reproach herself for loving him so little, and\r\nthinking his return a misfortune; and when, on having courage to lift\r\nher eyes to his face, she saw that he was grown thinner, and had the\r\nburnt, fagged, worn look of fatigue and a hot climate, every tender\r\nfeeling was increased, and she was miserable in considering how much\r\nunsuspected vexation was probably ready to burst on him.', 'But his intention, the kindness of his intention, was thankfully\r\nacknowledged: quite thankfully and warmly, for she was elevated beyond\r\nthe common timidity of her mind by the flow of her love for William.', 'This dear William would soon be amongst them.', 'It was long before Fanny could recover from the agitating happiness of\r\nsuch an hour as was formed by the last thirty minutes of expectation,\r\nand the first of fruition; it was some time even before her happiness\r\ncould be said to make her happy, before the disappointment inseparable\r\nfrom the alteration of person had vanished, and she could see in him\r\nthe same William as before, and talk to him, as her heart had been\r\nyearning to do through many a past year.', 'But with William\r\nand Fanny Price it was still a sentiment in all its prime and\r\nfreshness, wounded by no opposition of interest, cooled by no separate\r\nattachment, and feeling the influence of time and absence only in its\r\nincrease.', 'Young as he was, William had\r\nalready seen a great deal.', 'The glory of heroism, of usefulness, of exertion, of\r\nendurance, made his own habits of selfish indulgence appear in shameful\r\ncontrast; and he wished he had been a William Price, distinguishing\r\nhimself and working his way to fortune and consequence with so much\r\nself-respect and happy ardour, instead of what he was!', 'With spirits, courage, and\r\ncuriosity up to anything, William expressed an inclination to hunt; and\r\nCrawford could mount him without the slightest inconvenience to\r\nhimself, and with only some scruples to obviate in Sir Thomas, who knew\r\nbetter than his nephew the value of such a loan, and some alarms to\r\nreason away in Fanny.', 'She feared for William; by no means convinced by\r\nall that he could relate of his own horsemanship in various countries,\r\nof the scrambling parties in which he had been engaged, the rough\r\nhorses and mules he had ridden, or his many narrow escapes from\r\ndreadful falls, that he was at all equal to the management of a\r\nhigh-fed hunter in an English fox-chase; nor till he returned safe and\r\nwell, without accident or discredit, could she be reconciled to the\r\nrisk, or feel any of that obligation to Mr. Crawford for lending the\r\nhorse which he had fully intended it should produce.', 'When it was\r\nproved, however, to have done William no harm, she could allow it to be\r\na kindness, and even reward the owner with a smile when the animal was\r\none minute tendered to his use again; and the next, with the greatest\r\ncordiality, and in a manner not to be resisted, made over to his use\r\nentirely so long as he remained in Northamptonshire.', 'The return of Henry\r\nCrawford, and the arrival of William Price, had much to do with it, but\r\nmuch was still owing to Sir Thomas’s more than toleration of the\r\nneighbourly attempts at the Parsonage.', 'It was a fine\r\narrangement for Henry Crawford, who was close to Fanny, and with his\r\nhands full of business, having two persons’ cards to manage as well as\r\nhis own; for though it was impossible for Fanny not to feel herself\r\nmistress of the rules of the game in three minutes, he had yet to\r\ninspirit her play, sharpen her avarice, and harden her heart, which,\r\nespecially in any competition with William, was a work of some\r\ndifficulty; and as for Lady Bertram, he must continue in charge of all\r\nher fame and fortune through the whole evening; and if quick enough to\r\nkeep her from looking at her cards when the deal began, must direct her\r\nin whatever was to be done with them to the end of it.', 'I had forgotten having ever told you half so\r\nmuch of the place.”\r\n\r\nThornton Lacey was the name of his impending living, as Miss Crawford\r\nwell knew; and her interest in a negotiation for William Price’s knave\r\nincreased.', 'I\r\nthink the house and premises may be made comfortable, and given the air\r\nof a gentleman’s residence, without any very heavy expense, and that\r\nmust suffice me; and, I hope, may suffice all who care about me.”\r\n\r\nMiss Crawford, a little suspicious and resentful of a certain tone of\r\nvoice, and a certain half-look attending the last expression of his\r\nhope, made a hasty finish of her dealings with William Price; and\r\nsecuring his knave at an exorbitant rate, exclaimed, “There, I will\r\nstake my last like a woman of spirit.', 'The game will be yours,” turning to her again; “it\r\nwill certainly be yours.”\r\n\r\n“And Fanny had much rather it were William’s,” said Edmund, smiling at\r\nher.', 'I do not exactly\r\nknow the distance, but when you get back to Portsmouth, if it is not\r\nvery far off, you ought to go over and pay your respects to them; and I\r\ncould send a little parcel by you that I want to get conveyed to your\r\ncousins.”\r\n\r\n“I should be very happy, aunt; but Brighton is almost by Beachey Head;\r\nand if I could get so far, I could not expect to be welcome in such a\r\nsmart place as that—poor scrubby midshipman as I am.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris was beginning an eager assurance of the affability he might\r\ndepend on, when she was stopped by Sir Thomas’s saying with authority,\r\n“I do not advise your going to Brighton, William, as I trust you may\r\nsoon have more convenient opportunities of meeting; but my daughters\r\nwould be happy to see their cousins anywhere; and you will find Mr.\r\nRushworth most sincerely disposed to regard all the connexions of our\r\nfamily as his own.”\r\n\r\n“I would rather find him private secretary to the First Lord than\r\nanything else,” was William’s only answer, in an undervoice, not meant\r\nto reach far, and the subject dropped.', '“This is the assembly night,” said William.', '“If I were at Portsmouth I\r\nshould be at it, perhaps.”\r\n\r\n“But you do not wish yourself at Portsmouth, William?”\r\n\r\n“No, Fanny, that I do not.', 'But never mind it, William” (her own cheeks in a\r\nglow of indignation as she spoke).', 'only think, William, when you are a lieutenant, how\r\nlittle you will care for any nonsense of this kind.”\r\n\r\n“I begin to think I shall never be a lieutenant, Fanny.', 'my dear William, do not talk so; do not be so desponding.', 'My dear\r\nSir Thomas, we have settled it that the carriage should come back for\r\nyou, and Edmund and William.”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas could not dissent, as it had been his own arrangement,\r\npreviously communicated to his wife and sister; but _that_ seemed\r\nforgotten by Mrs. Norris, who must fancy that she settled it all\r\nherself.', 'He remained\r\nsteadily inclined to gratify so amiable a feeling; to gratify anybody\r\nelse who might wish to see Fanny dance, and to give pleasure to the\r\nyoung people in general; and having thought the matter over, and taken\r\nhis resolution in quiet independence, the result of it appeared the\r\nnext morning at breakfast, when, after recalling and commending what\r\nhis nephew had said, he added, “I do not like, William, that you should\r\nleave Northamptonshire without this indulgence.', 'Edmund, William, and Fanny did, in their different ways, look and speak\r\nas much grateful pleasure in the promised ball as Sir Thomas could\r\ndesire.', 'To her the cares were sometimes almost\r\nbeyond the happiness; for young and inexperienced, with small means of\r\nchoice and no confidence in her own taste, the “how she should be\r\ndressed” was a point of painful solicitude; and the almost solitary\r\nornament in her possession, a very pretty amber cross which William had\r\nbrought her from Sicily, was the greatest distress of all, for she had\r\nnothing but a bit of ribbon to fasten it to; and though she had worn it\r\nin that manner once, would it be allowable at such a time in the midst\r\nof all the rich ornaments which she supposed all the other young ladies\r\nwould appear in?', 'Thursday was the day of the ball; and on Wednesday morning Fanny, still\r\nunable to satisfy herself as to what she ought to wear, determined to\r\nseek the counsel of the more enlightened, and apply to Mrs. Grant and\r\nher sister, whose acknowledged taste would certainly bear her\r\nblameless; and as Edmund and William were gone to Northampton, and she\r\nhad reason to think Mr. Crawford likewise out, she walked down to the\r\nParsonage without much fear of wanting an opportunity for private\r\ndiscussion; and the privacy of such a discussion was a most important\r\npart of it to Fanny, being more than half-ashamed of her own\r\nsolicitude.', 'But Miss Crawford persevered, and argued the case with so much\r\naffectionate earnestness through all the heads of William and the\r\ncross, and the ball, and herself, as to be finally successful.', 'You\r\nwill find the beginning of a note to yourself; but I can now speak my\r\nbusiness, which is merely to beg your acceptance of this little\r\ntrifle—a chain for William’s cross.', 'The chain will agree with William’s cross\r\nbeyond all comparison better than the necklace.”\r\n\r\n“For one night, Fanny, for only one night, if it _be_ a sacrifice; I am\r\nsure you will, upon consideration, make that sacrifice rather than give\r\npain to one who has been so studious of your comfort.', 'Thursday, predestined to hope and enjoyment, came; and opened with more\r\nkindness to Fanny than such self-willed, unmanageable days often\r\nvolunteer, for soon after breakfast a very friendly note was brought\r\nfrom Mr. Crawford to William, stating that as he found himself obliged\r\nto go to London on the morrow for a few days, he could not help trying\r\nto procure a companion; and therefore hoped that if William could make\r\nup his mind to leave Mansfield half a day earlier than had been\r\nproposed, he would accept a place in his carriage.', 'Mr. Crawford meant\r\nto be in town by his uncle’s accustomary late dinner-hour, and William\r\nwas invited to dine with him at the Admiral’s.', 'The proposal was a very\r\npleasant one to William himself, who enjoyed the idea of travelling\r\npost with four horses, and such a good-humoured, agreeable friend; and,\r\nin likening it to going up with despatches, was saying at once\r\neverything in favour of its happiness and dignity which his imagination\r\ncould suggest; and Fanny, from a different motive, was exceedingly\r\npleased; for the original plan was that William should go up by the\r\nmail from Northampton the following night, which would not have allowed\r\nhim an hour’s rest before he must have got into a Portsmouth coach; and\r\nthough this offer of Mr. Crawford’s would rob her of many hours of his\r\ncompany, she was too happy in having William spared from the fatigue of\r\nsuch a journey, to think of anything else.', 'To dance without much observation or any\r\nextraordinary fatigue, to have strength and partners for about half the\r\nevening, to dance a little with Edmund, and not a great deal with Mr.\r\nCrawford, to see William enjoy himself, and be able to keep away from\r\nher aunt Norris, was the height of her ambition, and seemed to\r\ncomprehend her greatest possibility of happiness.', 'Since the first joy from Mr. Crawford’s note to William had worn\r\naway, she had been in a state absolutely the reverse; there had been no\r\ncomfort around, no hope within her.', 'His, therefore, must be worn; and having, with\r\ndelightful feelings, joined the chain and the cross—those memorials of\r\nthe two most beloved of her heart, those dearest tokens so formed for\r\neach other by everything real and imaginary—and put them round her\r\nneck, and seen and felt how full of William and Edmund they were, she\r\nwas able, without an effort, to resolve on wearing Miss Crawford’s\r\nnecklace too.', 'This was a hard duty, and she was never\r\nsummoned to it without looking at William, as he walked about at his\r\nease in the background of the scene, and longing to be with him.', 'But it was not to\r\nbe avoided: he made her feel that she was the object of all; though she\r\ncould not say that it was unpleasantly done, that there was indelicacy\r\nor ostentation in his manner; and sometimes, when he talked of William,\r\nhe was really not unagreeable, and shewed even a warmth of heart which\r\ndid him credit.', 'She was happy whenever she looked at William, and saw how\r\nperfectly he was enjoying himself, in every five minutes that she could\r\nwalk about with him and hear his account of his partners; she was happy\r\nin knowing herself admired; and she was happy in having the two dances\r\nwith Edmund still to look forward to, during the greatest part of the\r\nevening, her hand being so eagerly sought after that her indefinite\r\nengagement with _him_ was in continual perspective.', '“Poor Fanny!” cried William, coming for a moment to visit her, and\r\nworking away his partner’s fan as if for life, “how soon she is knocked\r\nup!', '“Yes, half-past nine,” said Crawford to William as the latter was\r\nleaving them, “and I shall be punctual, for there will be no kind\r\nsister to get up for _me_.” And in a lower tone to Fanny, “I shall have\r\nonly a desolate house to hurry from.', 'She had hoped to have William all to herself the last\r\nmorning.', 'CHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ball was over, and the breakfast was soon over too; the last kiss\r\nwas given, and William was gone.', 'After seeing William to the last moment, Fanny walked back to the\r\nbreakfast-room with a very saddened heart to grieve over the melancholy\r\nchange; and there her uncle kindly left her to cry in peace,\r\nconceiving, perhaps, that the deserted chair of each young man might\r\nexercise her tender enthusiasm, and that the remaining cold pork bones\r\nand mustard in William’s plate might but divide her feelings with the\r\nbroken egg-shells in Mr. Crawford’s.', 'Fanny’s disposition was such that she could never even think of her\r\naunt Norris in the meagreness and cheerlessness of her own small house,\r\nwithout reproaching herself for some little want of attention to her\r\nwhen they had been last together; much less could her feelings acquit\r\nher of having done and said and thought everything by William that was\r\ndue to him for a whole fortnight.', '“She could not recollect what it\r\nwas that she had heard about one of the Miss Maddoxes, or what it was\r\nthat Lady Prescott had noticed in Fanny: she was not sure whether\r\nColonel Harrison had been talking of Mr. Crawford or of William when he\r\nsaid he was the finest young man in the room—somebody had whispered\r\nsomething to her; she had forgot to ask Sir Thomas what it could be.”\r\nAnd these were her longest speeches and clearest communications: the\r\nrest was only a languid “Yes, yes; very well; did you?', 'She could think of William\r\nthe next day more cheerfully; and as the morning afforded her an\r\nopportunity of talking over Thursday night with Mrs. Grant and Miss\r\nCrawford, in a very handsome style, with all the heightenings of\r\nimagination, and all the laughs of playfulness which are so essential\r\nto the shade of a departed ball, she could afterwards bring her mind\r\nwithout much effort into its everyday state, and easily conform to the\r\ntranquillity of the present quiet week.', 'He could not have devised anything more likely to raise his consequence\r\nthan this week’s absence, occurring as it did at the very time of her\r\nbrother’s going away, of William Price’s going too, and completing the\r\nsort of general break-up of a party which had been so animated.', 'The first was from the Admiral to\r\ninform his nephew, in a few words, of his having succeeded in the\r\nobject he had undertaken, the promotion of young Price, and enclosing\r\ntwo more, one from the Secretary of the First Lord to a friend, whom\r\nthe Admiral had set to work in the business, the other from that friend\r\nto himself, by which it appeared that his lordship had the very great\r\nhappiness of attending to the recommendation of Sir Charles; that Sir\r\nCharles was much delighted in having such an opportunity of proving his\r\nregard for Admiral Crawford, and that the circumstance of Mr. William\r\nPrice’s commission as Second Lieutenant of H.M. Sloop Thrush being made\r\nout was spreading general joy through a wide circle of great people.', '_Now_ I may say that even I\r\ncould not require William Price to excite a greater interest, or be\r\nfollowed by warmer wishes and higher commendation, than were most\r\nvoluntarily bestowed by my uncle after the evening they had passed\r\ntogether.”\r\n\r\n“Has this been all _your_ doing, then?” cried Fanny.', 'He had communicated it to no creature: he\r\nhad not breathed a syllable of it even to Mary; while uncertain of the\r\nissue, he could not have borne any participation of his feelings, but\r\nthis had been his business; and he spoke with such a glow of what his\r\nsolicitude had been, and used such strong expressions, was so abounding\r\nin the _deepest_ _interest_, in _twofold_ _motives_, in _views_ _and_\r\n_wishes_ _more_ _than_ _could_ _be_ _told_, that Fanny could not have\r\nremained insensible of his drift, had she been able to attend; but her\r\nheart was so full and her senses still so astonished, that she could\r\nlisten but imperfectly even to what he told her of William, and saying\r\nonly when he paused, “How kind!', 'Dearest, dearest William!” She jumped up and\r\nmoved in haste towards the door, crying out, “I will go to my uncle.', 'While her heart was still bounding with joy\r\nand gratitude on William’s behalf, she could not be severely resentful\r\nof anything that injured only herself; and after having twice drawn\r\nback her hand, and twice attempted in vain to turn away from him, she\r\ngot up, and said only, with much agitation, “Don’t, Mr. Crawford, pray\r\ndon’t!', 'Your kindness to William makes\r\nme more obliged to you than words can express; but I do not want, I\r\ncannot bear, I must not listen to such—No, no, don’t think of me.', 'But William was a lieutenant.', 'Mr. Crawford would certainly never address her so again: he must\r\nhave seen how unwelcome it was to her; and in that case, how gratefully\r\nshe could esteem him for his friendship to William!', 'She would not stir farther from the East room than the head of the\r\ngreat staircase, till she had satisfied herself of Mr. Crawford’s\r\nhaving left the house; but when convinced of his being gone, she was\r\neager to go down and be with her uncle, and have all the happiness of\r\nhis joy as well as her own, and all the benefit of his information or\r\nhis conjectures as to what would now be William’s destination.', 'Sir\r\nThomas was as joyful as she could desire, and very kind and\r\ncommunicative; and she had so comfortable a talk with him about William\r\nas to make her feel as if nothing had occurred to vex her, till she\r\nfound, towards the close, that Mr. Crawford was engaged to return and\r\ndine there that very day.', 'She could not have supposed it in the power of any\r\nconcurrence of circumstances to give her so many painful sensations on\r\nthe first day of hearing of William’s promotion.', 'She would hardly join even when William\r\nwas the subject, for his commission came all from the right hand too,\r\nand there was pain in the connexion.', 'She thought Lady Bertram sat longer than ever, and began to be in\r\ndespair of ever getting away; but at last they were in the\r\ndrawing-room, and she was able to think as she would, while her aunts\r\nfinished the subject of William’s appointment in their own style.', '“_Now_ William would be able to keep\r\nhimself, which would make a vast difference to his uncle, for it was\r\nunknown how much he had cost his uncle; and, indeed, it would make some\r\ndifference in _her_ presents too.', 'Quite unpractised in such sort of note-writing, had there\r\nbeen time for scruples and fears as to style she would have felt them\r\nin abundance: but something must be instantly written; and with only\r\none decided feeling, that of wishing not to appear to think anything\r\nreally intended, she wrote thus, in great trembling both of spirits and\r\nhand—\r\n\r\n“I am very much obliged to you, my dear Miss Crawford, for your kind\r\ncongratulations, as far as they relate to my dearest William.', 'Fanny thought she had never known a day of greater agitation, both of\r\npain and pleasure; but happily the pleasure was not of a sort to die\r\nwith the day; for every day would restore the knowledge of William’s\r\nadvancement, whereas the pain, she hoped, would return no more.', 'It is very uncertain\r\nwhen my interest might have got William on.', 'He was now the Mr.\r\nCrawford who was addressing herself with ardent, disinterested love;\r\nwhose feelings were apparently become all that was honourable and\r\nupright, whose views of happiness were all fixed on a marriage of\r\nattachment; who was pouring out his sense of her merits, describing and\r\ndescribing again his affection, proving as far as words could prove it,\r\nand in the language, tone, and spirit of a man of talent too, that he\r\nsought her for her gentleness and her goodness; and to complete the\r\nwhole, he was now the Mr. Crawford who had procured William’s\r\npromotion!', 'She is hurt, as you would be for William; but she loves and\r\nesteems you with all her heart.”\r\n\r\n“I knew she would be very angry with me.”\r\n\r\n“My dearest Fanny,” cried Edmund, pressing her arm closer to him, “do\r\nnot let the idea of her anger distress you.', 'What a happy creature William must be!', 'The recollection of what had been done for William was\r\nalways the most powerful disturber of every decision against Mr.\r\nCrawford; and she sat thinking deeply of it till Mary, who had been\r\nfirst watching her complacently, and then musing on something else,\r\nsuddenly called her attention by saying: “I should like to sit talking\r\nwith you here all day, but we must not forget the ladies below, and so\r\ngood-bye, my dear, my amiable, my excellent Fanny, for though we shall\r\nnominally part in the breakfast-parlour, I must take leave of you here.', 'Had Fanny been at all addicted to raptures, she must have had a strong\r\nattack of them when she first understood what was intended, when her\r\nuncle first made her the offer of visiting the parents, and brothers,\r\nand sisters, from whom she had been divided almost half her life; of\r\nreturning for a couple of months to the scenes of her infancy, with\r\nWilliam for the protector and companion of her journey, and the\r\ncertainty of continuing to see William to the last hour of his\r\nremaining on land.', 'Afterwards, when familiarised\r\nwith the visions of enjoyment so suddenly opened, she could speak more\r\nlargely to William and Edmund of what she felt; but still there were\r\nemotions of tenderness that could not be clothed in words.', 'How right and comfortable it will all be!”\r\n\r\nBy the time Mrs. Price’s answer arrived, there remained but a very few\r\ndays more to be spent at Mansfield; and for part of one of those days\r\nthe young travellers were in a good deal of alarm on the subject of\r\ntheir journey, for when the mode of it came to be talked of, and Mrs.\r\nNorris found that all her anxiety to save her brother-in-law’s money\r\nwas vain, and that in spite of her wishes and hints for a less\r\nexpensive conveyance of Fanny, they were to travel post; when she saw\r\nSir Thomas actually give William notes for the purpose, she was struck\r\nwith the idea of there being room for a third in the carriage, and\r\nsuddenly seized with a strong inclination to go with them, to go and\r\nsee her poor dear sister Price.', 'CHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe novelty of travelling, and the happiness of being with William,\r\nsoon produced their natural effect on Fanny’s spirits, when Mansfield\r\nPark was fairly left behind; and by the time their first stage was\r\nended, and they were to quit Sir Thomas’s carriage, she was able to\r\ntake leave of the old coachman, and send back proper messages, with\r\ncheerful looks.', 'Everything supplied an amusement to the high glee of William’s mind,\r\nand he was full of frolic and joke in the intervals of their\r\nhigher-toned subjects, all of which ended, if they did not begin, in\r\npraise of the Thrush, conjectures how she would be employed, schemes\r\nfor an action with some superior force, which (supposing the first\r\nlieutenant out of the way, and William was not very merciful to the\r\nfirst lieutenant) was to give himself the next step as soon as\r\npossible, or speculations upon prize-money, which was to be generously\r\ndistributed at home, with only the reservation of enough to make the\r\nlittle cottage comfortable, in which he and Fanny were to pass all\r\ntheir middle and later life together.', 'They passed the\r\ndrawbridge, and entered the town; and the light was only beginning to\r\nfail as, guided by William’s powerful voice, they were rattled into a\r\nnarrow street, leading from the High Street, and drawn up before the\r\ndoor of a small house now inhabited by Mr. Price.', 'The\r\nmoment they stopped, a trollopy-looking maidservant, seemingly in\r\nwaiting for them at the door, stepped forward, and more intent on\r\ntelling the news than giving them any help, immediately began with,\r\n“The Thrush is gone out of harbour, please sir, and one of the officers\r\nhas been here to—” She was interrupted by a fine tall boy of eleven\r\nyears old, who, rushing out of the house, pushed the maid aside, and\r\nwhile William was opening the chaise-door himself, called out, “You are\r\njust in time.', 'And Mr.\r\nCampbell was here at four o’clock to ask for you: he has got one of the\r\nThrush’s boats, and is going off to her at six, and hoped you would be\r\nhere in time to go with him.”\r\n\r\nA stare or two at Fanny, as William helped her out of the carriage, was\r\nall the voluntary notice which this brother bestowed; but he made no\r\nobjection to her kissing him, though still entirely engaged in\r\ndetailing farther particulars of the Thrush’s going out of harbour, in\r\nwhich he had a strong right of interest, being to commence his career\r\nof seamanship in her at this very time.', 'She was gone again to the street-door, to\r\nwelcome William.', 'my dear William, how glad I am to see you.', 'She lays close to the\r\nEndymion, between her and the Cleopatra, just to the eastward of the\r\nsheer hulk.”\r\n\r\n“Ha!” cried William, “_that’s_ just where I should have put her myself.', 'Fanny\r\nshrunk back to her seat, with feelings sadly pained by his language and\r\nhis smell of spirits; and he talked on only to his son, and only of the\r\nThrush, though William, warmly interested as he was in that subject,\r\nmore than once tried to make his father think of Fanny, and her long\r\nabsence and long journey.', 'After sitting some time longer, a candle was obtained; but as there was\r\nstill no appearance of tea, nor, from Betsey’s reports from the\r\nkitchen, much hope of any under a considerable period, William\r\ndetermined to go and change his dress, and make the necessary\r\npreparations for his removal on board directly, that he might have his\r\ntea in comfort afterwards.', 'Mrs. Price, Rebecca, and Betsey all went up to defend themselves, all\r\ntalking together, but Rebecca loudest, and the job was to be done as\r\nwell as it could in a great hurry; William trying in vain to send\r\nBetsey down again, or keep her from being troublesome where she was;\r\nthe whole of which, as almost every door in the house was open, could\r\nbe plainly distinguished in the parlour, except when drowned at\r\nintervals by the superior noise of Sam, Tom, and Charles chasing each\r\nother up and down stairs, and tumbling about and hallooing.', 'Susan had an open,\r\nsensible countenance; she was like William, and Fanny hoped to find her\r\nlike him in disposition and goodwill towards herself.', 'In this more placid state of things William reentered, followed not far\r\nbehind by his mother and Betsey.', 'CHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nCould Sir Thomas have seen all his niece’s feelings, when she wrote her\r\nfirst letter to her aunt, he would not have despaired; for though a\r\ngood night’s rest, a pleasant morning, the hope of soon seeing William\r\nagain, and the comparatively quiet state of the house, from Tom and\r\nCharles being gone to school, Sam on some project of his own, and her\r\nfather on his usual lounges, enabled her to express herself cheerfully\r\non the subject of home, there were still, to her own perfect\r\nconsciousness, many drawbacks suppressed.', 'Everything in that quarter failed her, except William’s\r\naffection.', 'She was fond of her sons, especially of William, but Betsey was the\r\nfirst of her girls whom she had ever much regarded.', 'The consciousness of his being known there\r\nonly as William’s friend was some support.', 'They talked of William, a subject on which Mrs. Price could never tire;\r\nand Mr. Crawford was as warm in his commendation as even her heart\r\ncould wish.']

Il nome ' Lady Bertram ' appare in queste frasi:
['Sir Thomas sent friendly advice and professions, Lady Bertram\r\ndispatched money and baby-linen, and Mrs. Norris wrote the letters.', 'The trouble and\r\nexpense of it to them would be nothing, compared with the benevolence\r\nof the action.” Lady Bertram agreed with her instantly.', 'When the subject was brought forward again, her views were more fully\r\nexplained; and, in reply to Lady Bertram’s calm inquiry of “Where shall\r\nthe child come to first, sister, to you or to us?” Sir Thomas heard\r\nwith some surprise that it would be totally out of Mrs. Norris’s power\r\nto take any share in the personal charge of her.', '“Then she had better come to us,” said Lady Bertram, with the utmost\r\ncomposure.', 'It will be an education for the\r\nchild, said I, only being with her cousins; if Miss Lee taught her\r\nnothing, she would learn to be good and clever from _them_.”\r\n\r\n“I hope she will not tease my poor pug,” said Lady Bertram; “I have but\r\njust got Julia to leave it alone.”\r\n\r\n“There will be some difficulty in our way, Mrs. Norris,” observed Sir\r\nThomas, “as to the distinction proper to be made between the girls as\r\nthey grow up: how to preserve in the minds of my _daughters_ the\r\nconsciousness of what they are, without making them think too lowly of\r\ntheir cousin; and how, without depressing her spirits too far, to make\r\nher remember that she is not a _Miss Bertram_.', 'Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram received her very kindly; and Sir\r\nThomas, seeing how much she needed encouragement, tried to be all that\r\nwas conciliating: but he had to work against a most untoward gravity of\r\ndeportment; and Lady Bertram, without taking half so much trouble, or\r\nspeaking one word where he spoke ten, by the mere aid of a\r\ngood-humoured smile, became immediately the less awful character of the\r\ntwo.', 'In vain were the well-meant condescensions of\r\nSir Thomas, and all the officious prognostications of Mrs. Norris that\r\nshe would be a good girl; in vain did Lady Bertram smile and make her\r\nsit on the sofa with herself and pug, and vain was even the sight of a\r\ngooseberry tart towards giving her comfort; she could scarcely swallow\r\ntwo mouthfuls before tears interrupted her, and sleep seeming to be her\r\nlikeliest friend, she was taken to finish her sorrows in bed.', 'To the education of her daughters Lady Bertram paid not the smallest\r\nattention.', 'From about the time of her entering the family, Lady Bertram, in\r\nconsequence of a little ill-health, and a great deal of indolence, gave\r\nup the house in town, which she had been used to occupy every spring,\r\nand remained wholly in the country, leaving Sir Thomas to attend his\r\nduty in Parliament, with whatever increase or diminution of comfort\r\nmight arise from her absence.', '“Live with me, dear Lady Bertram!', 'You always do, don’t you?”\r\n\r\n“My object, Lady Bertram, is to be of use to those that come after me.', 'Sir Thomas has been writing about it,\r\nI know.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Lady Bertram,” said Mrs. Norris, moving to go, “I can only say\r\nthat my sole desire is to be of use to your family: and so, if Sir\r\nThomas should ever speak again about my taking Fanny, you will be able\r\nto say that my health and spirits put it quite out of the question;\r\nbesides that, I really should not have a bed to give her, for I must\r\nkeep a spare room for a friend.”\r\n\r\nLady Bertram repeated enough of this conversation to her husband to\r\nconvince him how much he had mistaken his sister-in-law’s views; and\r\nshe was from that moment perfectly safe from all expectation, or the\r\nslightest allusion to it from him.', 'He could not\r\nthink Lady Bertram quite equal to supply his place with them, or\r\nrather, to perform what should have been her own; but, in Mrs. Norris’s\r\nwatchful attention, and in Edmund’s judgment, he had sufficient\r\nconfidence to make him go without fears for their conduct.', 'CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nTom Bertram had of late spent so little of his time at home that he\r\ncould be only nominally missed; and Lady Bertram was soon astonished to\r\nfind how very well they did even without his father, how well Edmund\r\ncould supply his place in carving, talking to the steward, writing to\r\nthe attorney, settling with the servants, and equally saving her from\r\nall possible fatigue or exertion in every particular but that of\r\ndirecting her letters.', 'Fanny had no share in the festivities of the season; but she enjoyed\r\nbeing avowedly useful as her aunt’s companion when they called away the\r\nrest of the family; and, as Miss Lee had left Mansfield, she naturally\r\nbecame everything to Lady Bertram during the night of a ball or a\r\nparty.', 'They took their cheerful rides in the fine mornings of April and May;\r\nand Fanny either sat at home the whole day with one aunt, or walked\r\nbeyond her strength at the instigation of the other: Lady Bertram\r\nholding exercise to be as unnecessary for everybody as it was\r\nunpleasant to herself; and Mrs. Norris, who was walking all day,\r\nthinking everybody ought to walk as much.', 'Mrs.\r\nNorris was most zealous in promoting the match, by every suggestion and\r\ncontrivance likely to enhance its desirableness to either party; and,\r\namong other means, by seeking an intimacy with the gentleman’s mother,\r\nwho at present lived with him, and to whom she even forced Lady Bertram\r\nto go through ten miles of indifferent road to pay a morning visit.', 'Rushworth,” said Lady Bertram, “if I were you, I would have a very\r\npretty shrubbery.', 'Between ten and eleven Edmund and Julia walked into the drawing-room,\r\nfresh with the evening air, glowing and cheerful, the very reverse of\r\nwhat they found in the three ladies sitting there, for Maria would\r\nscarcely raise her eyes from her book, and Lady Bertram was\r\nhalf-asleep; and even Mrs. Norris, discomposed by her niece’s\r\nill-humour, and having asked one or two questions about the dinner,\r\nwhich were not immediately attended to, seemed almost determined to say\r\nno more.', 'Suppose you let her have your aromatic vinegar; I always\r\nforget to have mine filled.”\r\n\r\n“She has got it,” said Lady Bertram; “she has had it ever since she\r\ncame back from your house the second time.”\r\n\r\n“What!” cried Edmund; “has she been walking as well as cutting roses;\r\nwalking across the hot park to your house, and doing it twice, ma’am?', '“I was afraid it would be too much for her,” said Lady Bertram; “but\r\nwhen the roses were gathered, your aunt wished to have them, and then\r\nyou know they must be taken home.”\r\n\r\n“But were there roses enough to oblige her to go twice?”\r\n\r\n“No; but they were to be put into the spare room to dry; and,\r\nunluckily, Fanny forgot to lock the door of the room and bring away the\r\nkey, so she was obliged to go again.”\r\n\r\nEdmund got up and walked about the room, saying, “And could nobody be\r\nemployed on such an errand but Fanny?', 'Between ourselves, Edmund,” nodding significantly at his mother, “it\r\nwas cutting the roses, and dawdling about in the flower-garden, that\r\ndid the mischief.”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid it was, indeed,” said the more candid Lady Bertram, who\r\nhad overheard her; “I am very much afraid she caught the headache\r\nthere, for the heat was enough to kill anybody.', 'It was\r\nhardly possible, indeed, that anything else should be talked of, for\r\nMrs. Norris was in high spirits about it; and Mrs. Rushworth, a\r\nwell-meaning, civil, prosing, pompous woman, who thought nothing of\r\nconsequence, but as it related to her own and her son’s concerns, had\r\nnot yet given over pressing Lady Bertram to be of the party.', 'He can go on\r\nhorseback, you know.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Rushworth being obliged to yield to Lady Bertram’s staying at\r\nhome, could only be sorry.', 'Tom, returning from them into the drawing-room, where Edmund was\r\nstanding thoughtfully by the fire, while Lady Bertram was on the sofa\r\nat a little distance, and Fanny close beside her arranging her work,\r\nthus began as he entered—“Such a horribly vile billiard-table as ours\r\nis not to be met with, I believe, above ground.', 'The play will be given up, and your delicacy honoured as\r\nit ought.”\r\n\r\n“Do not act anything improper, my dear,” said Lady Bertram.', 'we can\r\ndo nothing without you,” followed the first salutations; and Henry\r\nCrawford was soon seated with the other three at the table, while his\r\nsister made her way to Lady Bertram, and with pleasant attention was\r\ncomplimenting _her_.', 'She was very civilly answered by Lady Bertram, but Edmund said nothing.', 'All were alert and impatient; the ladies moved soon, the\r\ngentlemen soon followed them, and with the exception of Lady Bertram,\r\nMrs. Norris, and Julia, everybody was in the theatre at an early hour;\r\nand having lighted it up as well as its unfinished state admitted, were\r\nwaiting only the arrival of Mrs. Grant and the Crawfords to begin.', 'His business in Antigua had\r\nlatterly been prosperously rapid, and he came directly from Liverpool,\r\nhaving had an opportunity of making his passage thither in a private\r\nvessel, instead of waiting for the packet; and all the little\r\nparticulars of his proceedings and events, his arrivals and departures,\r\nwere most promptly delivered, as he sat by Lady Bertram and looked with\r\nheartfelt satisfaction on the faces around him—interrupting himself\r\nmore than once, however, to remark on his good fortune in finding them\r\nall at home—coming unexpectedly as he did—all collected together\r\nexactly as he could have wished, but dared not depend on.', '“But indeed\r\nI would rather have nothing but tea.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, Lady Bertram, suppose you speak for tea directly; suppose\r\nyou hurry Baddeley a little; he seems behindhand to-night.” She carried\r\nthis point, and Sir Thomas’s narrative proceeded.', 'His immediate communications were\r\nexhausted, and it seemed enough to be looking joyfully around him, now\r\nat one, now at another of the beloved circle; but the pause was not\r\nlong: in the elation of her spirits Lady Bertram became talkative, and\r\nwhat were the sensations of her children upon hearing her say, “How do\r\nyou think the young people have been amusing themselves lately, Sir\r\nThomas?', 'She had a\r\ngreat deal to insinuate in her own praise as to _general_ attention to\r\nthe interest and comfort of his family, much exertion and many\r\nsacrifices to glance at in the form of hurried walks and sudden\r\nremovals from her own fireside, and many excellent hints of distrust\r\nand economy to Lady Bertram and Edmund to detail, whereby a most\r\nconsiderable saving had always arisen, and more than one bad servant\r\nbeen detected.', 'But they had seen no one from the Parsonage,\r\nnot a creature, and had heard no tidings beyond a friendly note of\r\ncongratulation and inquiry from Mrs. Grant to Lady Bertram.', 'CHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n\r\n“But why should Mrs. Grant ask Fanny?” said Lady Bertram.', 'It\r\nbegan, on Lady Bertram’s part, with—“I have something to tell you that\r\nwill surprise you.', 'Mrs. Grant’s shewing civility to Miss\r\nPrice, to Lady Bertram’s niece, could never want explanation.', 'She had neither sympathy nor\r\nassistance from those who ought to have entered into her feelings and\r\ndirected her taste; for Lady Bertram never thought of being useful to\r\nanybody, and Mrs. Norris, when she came on the morrow, in consequence\r\nof an early call and invitation from Sir Thomas, was in a very ill\r\nhumour, and seemed intent only on lessening her niece’s pleasure, both\r\npresent and future, as much as possible.', 'You must preach at Mansfield, you know, that\r\nSir Thomas and Lady Bertram may hear you.”\r\n\r\n“I shall keep clear of you, Crawford, as long as I can,” said Edmund;\r\n“for you would be more likely to disconcert me, and I should be more\r\nsorry to see you trying at it than almost any other man.”\r\n\r\n“Will he not feel this?” thought Fanny.', 'With such means in his power he had a right to be listened to; and\r\nthough Mrs. Norris could fidget about the room, and disturb everybody\r\nin quest of two needlefuls of thread or a second-hand shirt button, in\r\nthe midst of her nephew’s account of a shipwreck or an engagement,\r\neverybody else was attentive; and even Lady Bertram could not hear of\r\nsuch horrors unmoved, or without sometimes lifting her eyes from her\r\nwork to say, “Dear me!', 'His readiness, however, in agreeing to dine at the Parsonage, when the\r\ngeneral invitation was at last hazarded, after many debates and many\r\ndoubts as to whether it were worth while, “because Sir Thomas seemed so\r\nill inclined, and Lady Bertram was so indolent!” proceeded from\r\ngood-breeding and goodwill alone, and had nothing to do with Mr.\r\nCrawford, but as being one in an agreeable group: for it was in the\r\ncourse of that very visit that he first began to think that any one in\r\nthe habit of such idle observations _would_ _have_ _thought_ that Mr.\r\nCrawford was the admirer of Fanny Price.', 'In the evening it was found, according to the predetermination of Mrs.\r\nGrant and her sister, that after making up the whist-table there would\r\nremain sufficient for a round game, and everybody being as perfectly\r\ncomplying and without a choice as on such occasions they always are,\r\nspeculation was decided on almost as soon as whist; and Lady Bertram\r\nsoon found herself in the critical situation of being applied to for\r\nher own choice between the games, and being required either to draw a\r\ncard for whist or not.', 'I know nothing about it, but Fanny must teach\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nHere Fanny interposed, however, with anxious protestations of her own\r\nequal ignorance; she had never played the game nor seen it played in\r\nher life; and Lady Bertram felt a moment’s indecision again; but upon\r\neverybody’s assuring her that nothing could be so easy, that it was the\r\neasiest game on the cards, and Henry Crawford’s stepping forward with a\r\nmost earnest request to be allowed to sit between her ladyship and Miss\r\nPrice, and teach them both, it was so settled; and Sir Thomas, Mrs.\r\nNorris, and Dr. and Mrs. Grant being seated at the table of prime\r\nintellectual state and dignity, the remaining six, under Miss\r\nCrawford’s direction, were arranged round the other.', 'It was a fine\r\narrangement for Henry Crawford, who was close to Fanny, and with his\r\nhands full of business, having two persons’ cards to manage as well as\r\nhis own; for though it was impossible for Fanny not to feel herself\r\nmistress of the rules of the game in three minutes, he had yet to\r\ninspirit her play, sharpen her avarice, and harden her heart, which,\r\nespecially in any competition with William, was a work of some\r\ndifficulty; and as for Lady Bertram, he must continue in charge of all\r\nher fame and fortune through the whole evening; and if quick enough to\r\nkeep her from looking at her cards when the deal began, must direct her\r\nin whatever was to be done with them to the end of it.', '(Let me see, Mary; Lady Bertram bids a dozen for\r\nthat queen; no, no, a dozen is more than it is worth.', '_She_\r\nmust be the doer of everything: Lady Bertram would of course be spared\r\nall thought and exertion, and it would all fall upon _her_.', 'The preparations meanwhile went on, and Lady Bertram continued to sit\r\non her sofa without any inconvenience from them.', 'Mrs. Chapman\r\nhad just reached the attic floor, when Miss Price came out of her room\r\ncompletely dressed, and only civilities were necessary; but Fanny felt\r\nher aunt’s attention almost as much as Lady Bertram or Mrs. Chapman\r\ncould do themselves.', '“Yes,” said Lady Bertram, “she looks very well.', 'What were the yawns of Lady Bertram?', 'When the carriages were really heard, when the guests began really to\r\nassemble, her own gaiety of heart was much subdued: the sight of so\r\nmany strangers threw her back into herself; and besides the gravity and\r\nformality of the first great circle, which the manners of neither Sir\r\nThomas nor Lady Bertram were of a kind to do away, she found herself\r\noccasionally called on to endure something worse.', '“Yes, she does look very well,” was Lady Bertram’s placid reply.', '“I cannot think what is the matter\r\nwith me,” said Lady Bertram, when the tea-things were removed.', 'This will be the last winter\r\nof his belonging to us, as he has done.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Lady Bertram, “but I wish he was not going away.', 'I wish they would stay at home.”\r\n\r\nThis wish was levelled principally at Julia, who had just applied for\r\npermission to go to town with Maria; and as Sir Thomas thought it best\r\nfor each daughter that the permission should be granted, Lady Bertram,\r\nthough in her own good-nature she would not have prevented it, was\r\nlamenting the change it made in the prospect of Julia’s return, which\r\nwould otherwise have taken place about this time.', 'If we have been kind to\r\n_her_, she is now quite as necessary to _us_.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Lady Bertram presently; “and it is a comfort to think that\r\nwe shall always have _her_.”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas paused, half smiled, glanced at his niece, and then gravely\r\nreplied, “She will never leave us, I hope, till invited to some other\r\nhome that may reasonably promise her greater happiness than she knows\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\n“And _that_ is not very likely to be, Sir Thomas.', 'The first half-hour was lost, for Fanny and Lady Bertram were together,\r\nand unless she had Fanny to herself she could hope for nothing.', 'But at\r\nlast Lady Bertram left the room, and then almost immediately Miss\r\nCrawford thus began, with a voice as well regulated as she could—“And\r\nhow do _you_ like your cousin Edmund’s staying away so long?', 'Henry had said he should just\r\ngo and ask the Bertrams how they did, and be back in ten minutes, but\r\nhe was gone above an hour; and when his sister, who had been waiting\r\nfor him to walk with her in the garden, met him at last most\r\nimpatiently in the sweep, and cried out, “My dear Henry, where can you\r\nhave been all this time?” he had only to say that he had been sitting\r\nwith Lady Bertram and Fanny.', 'The two ladies were\r\ntogether in the breakfast-room, and, fortunately for him, Lady Bertram\r\nwas on the very point of quitting it as he entered.', 'She thought Lady Bertram sat longer than ever, and began to be in\r\ndespair of ever getting away; but at last they were in the\r\ndrawing-room, and she was able to think as she would, while her aunts\r\nfinished the subject of William’s appointment in their own style.', 'She knew he must be at some expense, that he would have many\r\nthings to buy, though to be sure his father and mother would be able to\r\nput him in the way of getting everything very cheap; but she was very\r\nglad she had contributed her mite towards it.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad you gave him something considerable,” said Lady Bertram,\r\nwith most unsuspicious calmness, “for _I_ gave him only £10.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!” cried Mrs. Norris, reddening.', '“I shall find it immediately.” And\r\nby carefully giving way to the inclination of the leaves, he did find\r\nit, or within a page or two, quite near enough to satisfy Lady Bertram,\r\nwho assured him, as soon as he mentioned the name of Cardinal Wolsey,\r\nthat he had got the very speech.', 'If Lady Bertram, with all her\r\nincompetency and languor, could feel this, the inference of what her\r\nniece, alive and enlightened as she was, must feel, was elevating.', 'She absented herself as little as\r\npossible from Lady Bertram, kept away from the East room, and took no\r\nsolitary walk in the shrubbery, in her caution to avoid any sudden\r\nattack.', '“That may be, sister,” was all Lady Bertram’s reply.', 'Mrs. Norris was left to settle the matter by herself; and it\r\nended, to the infinite joy of her nephew and niece, in the recollection\r\nthat she could not possibly be spared from Mansfield Park at present;\r\nthat she was a great deal too necessary to Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram\r\nfor her to be able to answer it to herself to leave them even for a\r\nweek, and therefore must certainly sacrifice every other pleasure to\r\nthat of being useful to them.', 'Of her two sisters, Mrs. Price very much more resembled Lady Bertram\r\nthan Mrs. Norris.', 'Her disposition\r\nwas naturally easy and indolent, like Lady Bertram’s;

to think that where nature had made so\r\nlittle difference, circumstances should have made so much, and that her\r\nmother, as handsome as Lady Bertram, and some years her junior, should\r\nhave an appearance so much more worn and faded, so comfortless, so\r\nslatternly, so shabby.', 'Everybody at all addicted to letter-writing, without having much to\r\nsay, which will include a large proportion of the female world at\r\nleast, must feel with Lady Bertram that she was out of luck in having\r\nsuch a capital piece of Mansfield news as the certainty of the Grants\r\ngoing to Bath, occur at a time when she could make no advantage of it,\r\nand will admit that it must have been very mortifying to her to see it\r\nfall to the share of her thankless son, and treated as concisely as\r\npossible at the end of a long letter, instead of having it to spread\r\nover the largest part of a page of her own.', 'For though Lady Bertram\r\nrather shone in the epistolary line, having early in her marriage, from\r\nthe want of other employment, and the circumstance of Sir Thomas’s\r\nbeing in Parliament, got into the way of making and keeping\r\ncorrespondents, and formed for herself a very creditable, common-place,\r\namplifying style, so that a very little matter was enough for her: she\r\ncould not do entirely without any; she must have something to write\r\nabout, even to her niece; and being so soon to lose all the benefit of\r\nDr. Grant’s gouty symptoms and Mrs. Grant’s morning calls, it was very\r\nhard upon her to be deprived of one of the last epistolary uses she\r\ncould put them to.', 'The sufferings which Lady Bertram did not\r\nsee had little power over her fancy; and she wrote very comfortably\r\nabout agitation, and anxiety, and poor invalids, till Tom was actually\r\nconveyed to Mansfield, and her own eyes had beheld his altered\r\nappearance.', 'Mrs. Price did quite as much\r\nfor Lady Bertram as Lady Bertram would have done for Mrs. Price.', 'Three\r\nor four Prices might have been swept away, any or all except Fanny and\r\nWilliam, and Lady Bertram would have thought little about it;

for being now used to the sight of him in his\r\nsuffering, helpless state, and hearing only the best, and never\r\nthinking beyond what she heard, with no disposition for alarm and no\r\naptitude at a hint, Lady Bertram was the happiest subject in the world\r\nfor a little medical imposition.', 'A very few lines from Edmund shewed her the patient and the sickroom in\r\na juster and stronger light than all Lady Bertram’s sheets of paper\r\ncould do.', 'Fanny had scarcely passed the\r\nsolemn-looking servants, when Lady Bertram came from the drawing-room\r\nto meet her;

['Being now in her twenty-first year,\r\nMaria Bertram was beginning to think matrimony a duty; and as a\r\nmarriage with Mr. Rushworth would give her the enjoyment of a larger\r\nincome than her father’s, as well as ensure her the house in town,\r\nwhich was now a prime object, it became, by the same rule of moral\r\nobligation, her evident duty to marry Mr. Rushworth if she could.', 'Maria was indeed the pride and\r\ndelight of them all—perfectly faultless—an angel; and, of course, so\r\nsurrounded by admirers, must be difficult in her choice: but yet, as\r\nfar as Mrs. Norris could allow herself to decide on so short an\r\nacquaintance, Mr. Rushworth appeared precisely the young man to deserve\r\nand attach her.', 'After dancing with each other at a proper number of balls, the young\r\npeople justified these opinions, and an engagement, with a due\r\nreference to the absent Sir Thomas, was entered into, much to the\r\nsatisfaction of their respective families, and of the general\r\nlookers-on of the neighbourhood, who had, for many weeks past, felt the\r\nexpediency of Mr. Rushworth’s marrying Miss Bertram.', 'He could allow his sister to be\r\nthe best judge of her own happiness, but he was not pleased that her\r\nhappiness should centre in a large income; nor could he refrain from\r\noften saying to himself, in Mr. Rushworth’s company—“If this man had\r\nnot twelve thousand a year, he would be a very stupid fellow.”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas, however, was truly happy in the prospect of an alliance so\r\nunquestionably advantageous, and of which he heard nothing but the\r\nperfectly good and agreeable.', 'All is safe with a lady engaged: no harm can be\r\ndone.”\r\n\r\n“Why, as to that, Mr. Rushworth is a very good sort of young man, and\r\nit is a great match for her.”\r\n\r\n“But Miss Bertram does not care three straws for him; _that_ is your\r\nopinion of your intimate friend.', 'I am sure\r\nMiss Bertram is very much attached to Mr. Rushworth.', 'The soup would be sent round in a most\r\nspiritless manner, wine drank without any smiles or agreeable trifling,\r\nand the venison cut up without supplying one pleasant anecdote of any\r\nformer haunch, or a single entertaining story, about “my friend such a\r\none.” She must try to find amusement in what was passing at the upper\r\nend of the table, and in observing Mr. Rushworth, who was now making\r\nhis appearance at Mansfield for the first time since the Crawfords’\r\narrival.', 'I never saw a place that\r\nwanted so much improvement in my life; and it is so forlorn that I do\r\nnot know what can be done with it.”\r\n\r\n“No wonder that Mr. Rushworth should think so at present,” said Mrs.\r\nGrant to Mrs. Norris, with a smile; “but depend upon it, Sotherton will\r\nhave _every_ improvement in time which his heart can desire.”\r\n\r\n“I must try to do something with it,” said Mr. Rushworth, “but I do not\r\nknow what.', 'After a short interruption Mr. Rushworth began again.', 'Mr. Rushworth is quite right, I think, in meaning to give it a\r\nmodern dress, and I have no doubt that it will be all done extremely\r\nwell.”\r\n\r\nMiss Crawford listened with submission, and said to herself, “He is a\r\nwell-bred man;

and as Miss\r\nBertram caught at the idea likewise, and gave it her full support,\r\ndeclaring that, in her opinion, it was infinitely better to consult\r\nwith friends and disinterested advisers, than immediately to throw the\r\nbusiness into the hands of a professional man, Mr. Rushworth was very\r\nready to request the favour of Mr. Crawford’s assistance; and Mr.\r\nCrawford, after properly depreciating his own abilities, was quite at\r\nhis service in any way that could be useful.', 'Here are many\r\nthat would be interested in your improvements, my dear Mr. Rushworth,\r\nand that would like to hear Mr. Crawford’s opinion on the spot, and\r\nthat might be of some small use to you with _their_ opinions; and, for\r\nmy own part, I have been long wishing to wait upon your good mother\r\nagain; nothing but having no horses of my own could have made me so\r\nremiss; but now I could go and sit a few hours with Mrs. Rushworth,\r\nwhile the rest of you walked about and settled things, and then we\r\ncould all return to a late dinner here, or dine at Sotherton, just as\r\nmight be most agreeable to your mother, and have a pleasant drive home\r\nby moonlight.', 'It was meant and done by Mrs. Grant, with perfect\r\ngood-humour, on Mr. Rushworth’s account, who was partly expected at the\r\nPark that day; but it was felt as a very grievous injury, and her good\r\nmanners were severely taxed to conceal her vexation and anger till she\r\nreached home.', 'As Mr. Rushworth did _not_ come, the injury was\r\nincreased, and she had not even the relief of shewing her power over\r\nhim; she could only be sullen to her mother, aunt, and cousin, and\r\nthrow as great a gloom as possible over their dinner and dessert.', 'While she was gone Mr. Rushworth arrived, escorting his\r\nmother, who came to be civil and to shew her civility especially, in\r\nurging the execution of the plan for visiting Sotherton, which had been\r\nstarted a fortnight before, and which, in consequence of her subsequent\r\nabsence from home, had since lain dormant.', 'She could not tell Miss Crawford that\r\n“those woods belonged to Sotherton,” she could not carelessly observe\r\nthat “she believed that it was now all Mr. Rushworth’s property on each\r\nside of the road,” without elation of heart; and it was a pleasure to\r\nincrease with their approach to the capital freehold mansion, and\r\nancient manorial residence of the family, with all its rights of\r\ncourt-leet and court-baron.', 'It is oak\r\nentirely.”\r\n\r\nMiss Bertram could now speak with decided information of what she had\r\nknown nothing about when Mr. Rushworth had asked her opinion; and her\r\nspirits were in as happy a flutter as vanity and pride could furnish,\r\nwhen they drove up to the spacious stone steps before the principal\r\nentrance.', 'Prayers were always read in it by the domestic chaplain, within the\r\nmemory of many; but the late Mr. Rushworth left it off.”\r\n\r\n“Every generation has its improvements,” said Miss Crawford, with a\r\nsmile, to Edmund.', 'One\r\nwishes it were not so; but I have not yet left Oxford long enough to\r\nforget what chapel prayers are.”\r\n\r\nWhile this was passing, the rest of the party being scattered about the\r\nchapel, Julia called Mr. Crawford’s attention to her sister, by saying,\r\n“Do look at Mr. Rushworth and Maria, standing side by side, exactly as\r\nif the ceremony were going to be performed.', '“Upon my word, it is really a pity that it should not take place\r\ndirectly, if we had but a proper licence, for here we are altogether,\r\nand nothing in the world could be more snug and pleasant.” And she\r\ntalked and laughed about it with so little caution as to catch the\r\ncomprehension of Mr. Rushworth and his mother, and expose her sister to\r\nthe whispered gallantries of her lover, while Mrs. Rushworth spoke with\r\nproper smiles and dignity of its being a most happy event to her\r\nwhenever it took place.', 'How unlucky that\r\nyou are not ordained; Mr. Rushworth and Maria are quite ready.”\r\n\r\nMiss Crawford’s countenance, as Julia spoke, might have amused a\r\ndisinterested observer.', 'She listened, and at length she heard; she heard voices and feet\r\napproaching; but she had just satisfied herself that it was not those\r\nshe wanted, when Miss Bertram, Mr. Rushworth, and Mr. Crawford issued\r\nfrom the same path which she had trod herself, and were before her.', 'Nothing was fixed on;\r\nbut Henry Crawford was full of ideas and projects, and, generally\r\nspeaking, whatever he proposed was immediately approved, first by her,\r\nand then by Mr. Rushworth, whose principal business seemed to be to\r\nhear the others, and who scarcely risked an original thought of his own\r\nbeyond a wish that they had seen his friend Smith’s place.', 'They could not get through; and as Miss Bertram’s inclination for so\r\ndoing did by no means lessen, it ended in Mr. Rushworth’s declaring\r\noutright that he would go and fetch the key.', 'She\r\nexpected Mr. Rushworth, but it was Julia, who, hot and out of breath,\r\nand with a look of disappointment, cried out on seeing her, “Heyday!', '“But they cannot be very far off, and I think I\r\nam equal to as much as Maria, even without help.”\r\n\r\n“But, Julia, Mr. Rushworth will be here in a moment with the key.', 'Do\r\nwait for Mr. Rushworth.”\r\n\r\n“Not I, indeed.', 'It might have been as well, perhaps, if you had\r\nbeen in my place, but you always contrive to keep out of these\r\nscrapes.”\r\n\r\nThis was a most unjust reflection, but Fanny could allow for it, and\r\nlet it pass: Julia was vexed, and her temper was hasty; but she felt\r\nthat it would not last, and therefore, taking no notice, only asked her\r\nif she had not seen Mr. Rushworth.', 'The sort of dread in which Fanny now sat of\r\nseeing Mr. Rushworth prevented her thinking so much of their continued\r\nabsence, however, as she might have done.', 'She felt, as she looked at Julia and Mr. Rushworth,\r\nthat hers was not the only dissatisfied bosom amongst them: there was\r\ngloom on the face of each.', 'Mrs. Norris gave the\r\nparticulars of the letters, and the subject was dropt; but after tea,\r\nas Miss Crawford was standing at an open window with Edmund and Fanny\r\nlooking out on a twilight scene, while the Miss Bertrams, Mr.\r\nRushworth, and Henry Crawford were all busy with candles at the\r\npianoforte, she suddenly revived it by turning round towards the group,\r\nand saying, “How happy Mr. Rushworth looks!', 'He is thinking of\r\nNovember.”\r\n\r\nEdmund looked round at Mr. Rushworth too, but had nothing to say.', 'Maria, with only Mr. Rushworth to attend to her, and doomed to the\r\nrepeated details of his day’s sport, good or bad, his boast of his\r\ndogs, his jealousy of his neighbours, his doubts of their\r\nqualifications, and his zeal after poachers, subjects which will not\r\nfind their way to female feelings without some talent on one side or\r\nsome attachment on the other, had missed Mr. Crawford grievously; and\r\nJulia, unengaged and unemployed, felt all the right of missing him much\r\nmore.', 'CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Crawford accepted the part very readily; and soon after Miss\r\nBertram’s return from the Parsonage, Mr. Rushworth arrived, and another\r\ncharacter was consequently cast.', 'Thus much was settled before Edmund, who had been out all the morning,\r\nknew anything of the matter; but when he entered the drawing-room\r\nbefore dinner, the buzz of discussion was high between Tom, Maria, and\r\nMr. Yates; and Mr. Rushworth stepped forward with great alacrity to\r\ntell him the agreeable news.', '“Lovers’ Vows!” in a tone of the greatest amazement, was his only reply\r\nto Mr. Rushworth, and he turned towards his brother and sisters as if\r\nhardly doubting a contradiction.', 'As Mr. Rushworth is to act too, there can be no harm.', 'Mr. Yates, who was trying\r\nto make himself agreeable to Julia, found her gloom less impenetrable\r\non any topic than that of his regret at her secession from their\r\ncompany; and Mr. Rushworth, having only his own part and his own dress\r\nin his head, had soon talked away all that could be said of either.', 'Rushworth was to be Count Cassel, but no one had yet undertaken\r\nAnhalt.”\r\n\r\n“I had my choice of the parts,” said Mr. Rushworth; “but I thought I\r\nshould like the Count best, though I do not much relish the finery I am\r\nto have.”\r\n\r\n“You chose very wisely, I am sure,” replied Miss Crawford, with a\r\nbrightened look; “Anhalt is a heavy part.”\r\n\r\n“_The_ _Count_ has two-and-forty speeches,” returned Mr. Rushworth,\r\n“which is no trifle.”\r\n\r\n“I am not at all surprised,” said Miss Crawford, after a short pause,\r\n“at this want of an Anhalt.', 'It need not frighten\r\nyou: it is a nothing of a part, a mere nothing, not above half a dozen\r\nspeeches altogether, and it will not much signify if nobody hears a\r\nword you say; so you may be as creep-mouse as you like, but we must\r\nhave you to look at.”\r\n\r\n“If you are afraid of half a dozen speeches,” cried Mr. Rushworth,\r\n“what would you do with such a part as mine?', 'Mrs. Norris offered to contrive his\r\ndress, Mr. Yates assured him that Anhalt’s last scene with the Baron\r\nadmitted a good deal of action and emphasis, and Mr. Rushworth\r\nundertook to count his speeches.', 'Think of\r\nMr. Rushworth!”\r\n\r\n“You had better tell Miss Bertram to think of Mr. Rushworth.', 'I often think of Mr. Rushworth’s property and\r\nindependence, and wish them in other hands; but I never think of him.', 'I am sure _Julia_ does not, or she would not have flirted as she\r\ndid last night with Mr. Yates; and though he and Maria are very good\r\nfriends, I think she likes Sotherton too well to be inconstant.”\r\n\r\n“I would not give much for Mr. Rushworth’s chance if Henry stept in\r\nbefore the articles were signed.”\r\n\r\n“If you have such a suspicion, something must be done; and as soon as\r\nthe play is all over, we will talk to him seriously and make him know\r\nhis own mind; and if he means nothing, we will send him off, though he\r\nis Henry, for a time.”\r\n\r\nJulia _did_ suffer, however, though Mrs. Grant discerned it not, and\r\nthough it escaped the notice of many of her own family likewise.', '_She_ knew that Mr. Yates was in general thought to rant\r\ndreadfully; that Mr. Yates was disappointed in Henry Crawford; that Tom\r\nBertram spoke so quick he would be unintelligible; that Mrs. Grant\r\nspoiled everything by laughing; that Edmund was behindhand with his\r\npart, and that it was misery to have anything to do with Mr. Rushworth,\r\nwho was wanting a prompter through every speech.', 'She knew, also, that\r\npoor Mr. Rushworth could seldom get anybody to rehearse with him: _his_\r\ncomplaint came before her as well as the rest; and so decided to her\r\neye was her cousin Maria’s avoidance of him, and so needlessly often\r\nthe rehearsal of the first scene between her and Mr. Crawford, that she\r\nhad soon all the terror of other complaints from _him_.', 'For the life and soul of\r\nme, I cannot admire him; and, between ourselves, to see such an\r\nundersized, little, mean-looking man, set up for a fine actor, is very\r\nridiculous in my opinion.”\r\n\r\nFrom this moment there was a return of his former jealousy, which\r\nMaria, from increasing hopes of Crawford, was at little pains to\r\nremove; and the chances of Mr. Rushworth’s ever attaining to the\r\nknowledge of his two-and-forty speeches became much less.', 'I have been slaving myself\r\ntill I can hardly stand, to contrive Mr. Rushworth’s cloak without\r\nsending for any more satin; and now I think you may give me your help\r\nin putting it together.', 'By the bye, I looked in\r\nupon them five minutes ago, and it happened to be exactly at one of the\r\ntimes when they were trying _not_ to embrace, and Mr. Rushworth was\r\nwith me.', 'They walked off, utterly\r\nheedless of Mr. Rushworth’s repeated question of, “Shall I go too?', 'There was nothing\r\ndisagreeable in Mr. Rushworth’s appearance, and Sir Thomas was liking\r\nhim already.', 'Not that _she_ was incommoded by many fears of Sir Thomas’s\r\ndisapprobation when the present state of his house should be known, for\r\nher judgment had been so blinded that, except by the instinctive\r\ncaution with which she had whisked away Mr. Rushworth’s pink satin\r\ncloak as her brother-in-law entered, she could hardly be said to shew\r\nany sign of alarm; but she was vexed by the _manner_ of his return.', '“If I must say what I think,” continued Mr. Rushworth, “in my opinion\r\nit is very disagreeable to be always rehearsing.', 'But at your time of life to feel all this, is a most\r\nfavourable circumstance for yourself, and for everybody connected with\r\nyou; and I am sensible of the importance of having an ally of such\r\nweight.”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas meant to be giving Mr. Rushworth’s opinion in better words\r\nthan he could find himself.', 'He was aware that he must not expect a\r\ngenius in Mr. Rushworth;

for Mr. Rushworth is the sort of amiable modest young man who\r\nwants a great deal of encouragement, and there were girls enough on the\r\ncatch for him if we had been idle.', '‘Upon my\r\nword, Mrs. Norris,’ said Mrs. Grant the other day, ‘if Mr. Rushworth\r\nwere a son of your own, he could not hold Sir Thomas in greater\r\nrespect.’”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas gave up the point, foiled by her evasions, disarmed by her\r\nflattery;

for the first pleasures of Mr. Rushworth’s wife must be to\r\nfill her house, and give the best balls in the country.”\r\n\r\nFanny was silent, and Miss Crawford relapsed into thoughtfulness, till\r\nsuddenly looking up at the end of a few minutes, she exclaimed, “Ah!', 'here he is.” It was not Mr. Rushworth, however, but Edmund, who then\r\nappeared walking towards them with Mrs. Grant.', 'Well, I am much mistaken if his lovely Maria will ever\r\nwant him to make two-and-forty speeches to her”; adding, with a\r\nmomentary seriousness, “She is too good for him—much too good.” And\r\nthen changing his tone again to one of gentle gallantry, and addressing\r\nFanny, he said, “You were Mr. Rushworth’s best friend.', 'Your cousins are not of a sort to forget their\r\nrelations, and Mr. Rushworth is a most amiable man.', 'Maria\r\nis nobly married;

and Mr. and Mrs. Norris began their\r\ncareer of conjugal felicity with very little less than a thousand a\r\nyear.', 'Lady Bertram, who was a woman of very\r\ntranquil feelings, and a temper remarkably easy and indolent, would\r\nhave contented herself with merely giving up her sister, and thinking\r\nno more of the matter; but Mrs. Norris had a spirit of activity, which\r\ncould not be satisfied till she had written a long and angry letter to\r\nFanny, to point out the folly of her conduct, and threaten her with all\r\nits possible ill consequences.', 'Mrs. Price, in her turn, was injured and\r\nangry; and an answer, which comprehended each sister in its bitterness,\r\nand bestowed such very disrespectful reflections on the pride of Sir\r\nThomas as Mrs. Norris could not possibly keep to herself, put an end to\r\nall intercourse between them for a considerable period.', 'Their homes were so distant, and the circles in which they moved so\r\ndistinct, as almost to preclude the means of ever hearing of each\r\nother’s existence during the eleven following years, or, at least, to\r\nmake it very wonderful to Sir Thomas that Mrs. Norris should ever have\r\nit in her power to tell them, as she now and then did, in an angry\r\nvoice, that Fanny had got another child.', 'Sir Thomas sent friendly advice and professions, Lady Bertram\r\ndispatched money and baby-linen, and Mrs. Norris wrote the letters.', 'Mrs. Norris was\r\noften observing to the others that she could not get her poor sister\r\nand her family out of her head, and that, much as they had all done for\r\nher, she seemed to be wanting to do more; and at length she could not\r\nbut own it to be her wish that poor Mrs. Price should be relieved from\r\nthe charge and expense of one child entirely out of her great number.', ';—but no sooner had\r\nhe deliberately begun to state his objections, than Mrs. Norris\r\ninterrupted him with a reply to them all, whether stated or not.', 'Having no children of my own, who should I\r\nlook to in any little matter I may ever have to bestow, but the\r\nchildren of my sisters?—and I am sure Mr. Norris is too just—but you\r\nknow I am a woman of few words and professions.', 'I only meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in, and\r\nthat to make it really serviceable to Mrs. Price, and creditable to\r\nourselves, we must secure to the child, or consider ourselves engaged\r\nto secure to her hereafter, as circumstances may arise, the provision\r\nof a gentlewoman, if no such establishment should offer as you are so\r\nsanguine in expecting.”\r\n\r\n“I thoroughly understand you,” cried Mrs. Norris, “you are everything\r\nthat is generous and considerate, and I am sure we shall never disagree\r\non this point.', 'The\r\ndivision of gratifying sensations ought not, in strict justice, to have\r\nbeen equal; for Sir Thomas was fully resolved to be the real and\r\nconsistent patron of the selected child, and Mrs. Norris had not the\r\nleast intention of being at any expense whatever in her maintenance.', 'Had there been a family to\r\nprovide for, Mrs. Norris might never have saved her money; but having\r\nno care of that kind, there was nothing to impede her frugality, or\r\nlessen the comfort of making a yearly addition to an income which they\r\nhad never lived up to.', 'When the subject was brought forward again, her views were more fully\r\nexplained; and, in reply to Lady Bertram’s calm inquiry of “Where shall\r\nthe child come to first, sister, to you or to us?” Sir Thomas heard\r\nwith some surprise that it would be totally out of Mrs. Norris’s power\r\nto take any share in the personal charge of her.', 'Mrs. Norris was sorry to say that the\r\nlittle girl’s staying with them, at least as things then were, was\r\nquite out of the question.', 'Poor Mr. Norris’s indifferent state of\r\nhealth made it an impossibility: he could no more bear the noise of a\r\nchild than he could fly; if, indeed, he should ever get well of his\r\ngouty complaints, it would be a different matter: she should then be\r\nglad to take her turn, and think nothing of the inconvenience; but just\r\nnow, poor Mr. Norris took up every moment of her time, and the very\r\nmention of such a thing she was sure would distract him.', 'We will endeavour to do our duty by her, and\r\nshe will, at least, have the advantage of companions of her own age,\r\nand of a regular instructress.”\r\n\r\n“Very true,” cried Mrs. Norris, “which are both very important\r\nconsiderations; and it will be just the same to Miss Lee whether she\r\nhas three girls to teach, or only two—there can be no difference.', '“I hope she will prove a well-disposed girl,” continued Mrs. Norris,\r\n“and be sensible of her uncommon good fortune in having such friends.”\r\n\r\n“Should her disposition be really bad,” said Sir Thomas, “we must not,\r\nfor our own children’s sake, continue her in the family; but there is\r\nno reason to expect so great an evil.', 'Had my daughters been _younger_ than herself, I\r\nshould have considered the introduction of such a companion as a matter\r\nof very serious moment; but, as it is, I hope there can be nothing to\r\nfear for _them_, and everything to hope for _her_, from the\r\nassociation.”\r\n\r\n“That is exactly what I think,” cried Mrs. Norris, “and what I was\r\nsaying to my husband this morning.', 'It will be an education for the\r\nchild, said I, only being with her cousins; if Miss Lee taught her\r\nnothing, she would learn to be good and clever from _them_.”\r\n\r\n“I hope she will not tease my poor pug,” said Lady Bertram; “I have but\r\njust got Julia to leave it alone.”\r\n\r\n“There will be some difficulty in our way, Mrs. Norris,” observed Sir\r\nThomas, “as to the distinction proper to be made between the girls as\r\nthey grow up: how to preserve in the minds of my _daughters_ the\r\nconsciousness of what they are, without making them think too lowly of\r\ntheir cousin; and how, without depressing her spirits too far, to make\r\nher remember that she is not a _Miss Bertram_.', 'It is a point of great delicacy, and you must\r\nassist us in our endeavours to choose exactly the right line of\r\nconduct.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris was quite at his service; and though she perfectly agreed\r\nwith him as to its being a most difficult thing, encouraged him to hope\r\nthat between them it would be easily managed.', 'It will be readily believed that Mrs. Norris did not write to her\r\nsister in vain.', 'CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nThe little girl performed her long journey in safety; and at\r\nNorthampton was met by Mrs. Norris, who thus regaled in the credit of\r\nbeing foremost to welcome her, and in the importance of leading her in\r\nto the others, and recommending her to their kindness.', 'In vain were the well-meant condescensions of\r\nSir Thomas, and all the officious prognostications of Mrs. Norris that\r\nshe would be a good girl; in vain did Lady Bertram smile and make her\r\nsit on the sofa with herself and pug, and vain was even the sight of a\r\ngooseberry tart towards giving her comfort; she could scarcely swallow\r\ntwo mouthfuls before tears interrupted her, and sleep seeming to be her\r\nlikeliest friend, she was taken to finish her sorrows in bed.', '“This is not a very promising beginning,” said Mrs. Norris, when Fanny\r\nhad left the room.', 'I wish there may not be a\r\nlittle sulkiness of temper—her poor mother had a good deal; but we must\r\nmake allowances for such a child—and I do not know that her being sorry\r\nto leave her home is really against her, for, with all its faults, it\r\n_was_ her home, and she cannot as yet understand how much she has\r\nchanged for the better; but then there is moderation in all things.”\r\n\r\nIt required a longer time, however, than Mrs. Norris was inclined to\r\nallow, to reconcile Fanny to the novelty of Mansfield Park, and the\r\nseparation from everybody she had been used to.', 'She was disheartened by Lady\r\nBertram’s silence, awed by Sir Thomas’s grave looks, and quite overcome\r\nby Mrs. Norris’s admonitions.', 'The little rusticities and\r\nawkwardnesses which had at first made grievous inroads on the\r\ntranquillity of all, and not least of herself, necessarily wore away,\r\nand she was no longer materially afraid to appear before her uncle, nor\r\ndid her aunt Norris’s voice make her start very much.', 'As her appearance and spirits improved, Sir Thomas and Mrs. Norris\r\nthought with greater satisfaction of their benevolent plan; and it was\r\npretty soon decided between them that, though far from clever, she\r\nshowed a tractable disposition, and seemed likely to give them little\r\ntrouble.', 'But, all things considered, I do not know\r\nwhether it is not as well that it should be so, for, though you know\r\n(owing to me) your papa and mama are so good as to bring her up with\r\nyou, it is not at all necessary that she should be as accomplished as\r\nyou are;—on the contrary, it is much more desirable that there should\r\nbe a difference.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the counsels by which Mrs. Norris assisted to form her\r\nnieces’ minds; and it is not very wonderful that, with all their\r\npromising talents and early information, they should be entirely\r\ndeficient in the less common acquirements of self-knowledge, generosity\r\nand humility.', 'Mrs. Norris, on quitting the\r\nParsonage, removed first to the Park, and afterwards to a small house\r\nof Sir Thomas’s in the village, and consoled herself for the loss of\r\nher husband by considering that she could do very well without him; and\r\nfor her reduction of income by the evident necessity of stricter\r\neconomy.', 'On Mr. Norris’s death the presentation became the right of a Dr. Grant,\r\nwho came consequently to reside at Mansfield; and on proving to be a\r\nhearty man of forty-five, seemed likely to disappoint Mr. Bertram’s\r\ncalculations.', 'The time was now come when Sir Thomas expected his sister-in-law to\r\nclaim her share in their niece, the change in Mrs. Norris’s situation,\r\nand the improvement in Fanny’s age, seeming not merely to do away any\r\nformer objection to their living together, but even to give it the most\r\ndecided eligibility; and as his own circumstances were rendered less\r\nfair than heretofore, by some recent losses on his West India estate,\r\nin addition to his eldest son’s extravagance, it became not undesirable\r\nto himself to be relieved from the expense of her support, and the\r\nobligation of her future provision.', 'You have been five years\r\nwith us, and my sister always meant to take you when Mr. Norris died.', 'She\r\nhad never received kindness from her aunt Norris, and could not love\r\nher.', 'I\r\nam going to live entirely with my aunt Norris.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!”\r\n\r\n“Yes; my aunt Bertram has just told me so.', 'Mrs. Norris is much better\r\nfitted than my mother for having the charge of you now.', 'how I have trembled at my uncle’s\r\nopening his lips if horses were talked of), and then think of the kind\r\npains you took to reason and persuade me out of my fears, and convince\r\nme that I should like it after a little while, and feel how right you\r\nproved to be, I am inclined to hope you may always prophesy as well.”\r\n\r\n“And I am quite convinced that your being with Mrs. Norris will be as\r\ngood for your mind as riding has been for your health, and as much for\r\nyour ultimate happiness too.”\r\n\r\nSo ended their discourse, which, for any very appropriate service it\r\ncould render Fanny, might as well have been spared, for Mrs. Norris had\r\nnot the smallest intention of taking her.', 'Lady Bertram soon brought the matter to a\r\ncertainty by carelessly observing to Mrs. Norris—\r\n\r\n“I think, sister, we need not keep Miss Lee any longer, when Fanny goes\r\nto live with you.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris almost started.', 'A great many things were due from poor Mr. Norris, as clergyman of the\r\nparish, that cannot be expected from me.', 'Sir Thomas has been writing about it,\r\nI know.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Lady Bertram,” said Mrs. Norris, moving to go, “I can only say\r\nthat my sole desire is to be of use to your family: and so, if Sir\r\nThomas should ever speak again about my taking Fanny, you will be able\r\nto say that my health and spirits put it quite out of the question;\r\nbesides that, I really should not have a bed to give her, for I must\r\nkeep a spare room for a friend.”\r\n\r\nLady Bertram repeated enough of this conversation to her husband to\r\nconvince him how much he had mistaken his sister-in-law’s views; and\r\nshe was from that moment perfectly safe from all expectation, or the\r\nslightest allusion to it from him.', 'Mrs. Norris took possession of\r\nthe White House, the Grants arrived at the Parsonage, and these events\r\nover, everything at Mansfield went on for some time as usual.', 'They had\r\ntheir faults, and Mrs. Norris soon found them out.', 'Mrs. Norris could not speak with any temper of such\r\ngrievances, nor of the quantity of butter and eggs that were regularly\r\nconsumed in the house.', 'She could not enter into the wrongs of an economist, but she felt all\r\nthe injuries of beauty in Mrs. Grant’s being so well settled in life\r\nwithout being handsome, and expressed her astonishment on that point\r\nalmost as often, though not so diffusely, as Mrs. Norris discussed the\r\nother.', 'He could not\r\nthink Lady Bertram quite equal to supply his place with them, or\r\nrather, to perform what should have been her own; but, in Mrs. Norris’s\r\nwatchful attention, and in Edmund’s judgment, he had sufficient\r\nconfidence to make him go without fears for their conduct.', 'The earliest intelligence of the travellers’ safe arrival at Antigua,\r\nafter a favourable voyage, was received; though not before Mrs. Norris\r\nhad been indulging in very dreadful fears, and trying to make Edmund\r\nparticipate them whenever she could get him alone; and as she depended\r\non being the first person made acquainted with any fatal catastrophe,\r\nshe had already arranged the manner of breaking it to all the others,\r\nwhen Sir Thomas’s assurances of their both being alive and well made it\r\nnecessary to lay by her agitation and affectionate preparatory speeches\r\nfor a while.', 'The winter came and passed without their being called for; the accounts\r\ncontinued perfectly good; and Mrs. Norris, in promoting gaieties for\r\nher nieces, assisting their toilets, displaying their accomplishments,\r\nand looking about for their future husbands, had so much to do as, in\r\naddition to all her own household cares, some interference in those of\r\nher sister, and Mrs. Grant’s wasteful doings to overlook, left her very\r\nlittle occasion to be occupied in fears for the absent.', 'They took their cheerful rides in the fine mornings of April and May;\r\nand Fanny either sat at home the whole day with one aunt, or walked\r\nbeyond her strength at the instigation of the other: Lady Bertram\r\nholding exercise to be as unnecessary for everybody as it was\r\nunpleasant to herself; and Mrs. Norris, who was walking all day,\r\nthinking everybody ought to walk as much.', 'Mrs. Norris could not help\r\nthinking that some steady old thing might be found among the numbers\r\nbelonging to the Park that would do vastly well; or that one might be\r\nborrowed of the steward; or that perhaps Dr. Grant might now and then\r\nlend them the pony he sent to the post.', 'Mrs. Norris could not see it in the same light.', 'As the horse continued in name, as well as fact, the property of\r\nEdmund, Mrs. Norris could tolerate its being for Fanny’s use; and had\r\nLady Bertram ever thought about her own objection again, he might have\r\nbeen excused in her eyes for not waiting till Sir Thomas’s return in\r\nSeptember, for when September came Sir Thomas was still abroad, and\r\nwithout any near prospect of finishing his business.', 'Tom arrived\r\nsafely, bringing an excellent account of his father’s health; but to\r\nvery little purpose, as far as Mrs. Norris was concerned.', 'Mrs. Norris\r\naccepted the compliment, and admired the nice discernment of character\r\nwhich could so well distinguish merit.', 'Maria was indeed the pride and\r\ndelight of them all—perfectly faultless—an angel; and, of course, so\r\nsurrounded by admirers, must be difficult in her choice: but yet, as\r\nfar as Mrs. Norris could allow herself to decide on so short an\r\nacquaintance, Mr. Rushworth appeared precisely the young man to deserve\r\nand attach her.', 'I\r\ndeclare, when I got back to Sotherton yesterday, it looked like a\r\nprison—quite a dismal old prison.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, for shame!” cried Mrs. Norris.', 'I never saw a place that\r\nwanted so much improvement in my life; and it is so forlorn that I do\r\nnot know what can be done with it.”\r\n\r\n“No wonder that Mr. Rushworth should think so at present,” said Mrs.\r\nGrant to Mrs. Norris, with a smile; “but depend upon it, Sotherton will\r\nhave _every_ improvement in time which his heart can desire.”\r\n\r\n“I must try to do something with it,” said Mr. Rushworth, “but I do not\r\nknow what.', 'His terms are five guineas a day.”\r\n\r\n“Well, and if they were _ten_,” cried Mrs. Norris, “I am sure _you_\r\nneed not regard it.', 'It was only the spring twelvemonth before\r\nMr. Norris’s death that we put in the apricot against the stable wall,\r\nwhich is now grown such a noble tree, and getting to such perfection,\r\nsir,” addressing herself then to Dr. Grant.', 'It is an insipid fruit at the best; but a good apricot is eatable,\r\nwhich none from my garden are.”\r\n\r\n“The truth is, ma’am,” said Mrs. Grant, pretending to whisper across\r\nthe table to Mrs. Norris, “that Dr. Grant hardly knows what the natural\r\ntaste of our apricot is: he is scarcely ever indulged with one, for it\r\nis so valuable a fruit; with a little assistance, and ours is such a\r\nremarkably large, fair sort, that what with early tarts and preserves,\r\nmy cook contrives to get them all.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris, who had begun to redden, was appeased; and, for a little\r\nwhile, other subjects took place of the improvements of Sotherton.', 'Dr.\r\nGrant and Mrs. Norris were seldom good friends; their acquaintance had\r\nbegun in dilapidations, and their habits were totally dissimilar.', 'Mr. Rushworth then began\r\nto propose Mr. Crawford’s doing him the honour of coming over to\r\nSotherton, and taking a bed there; when Mrs. Norris, as if reading in\r\nher two nieces’ minds their little approbation of a plan which was to\r\ntake Mr. Crawford away, interposed with an amendment.', 'Fanny\r\nwas ready and waiting, and Mrs. Norris was beginning to scold her for\r\nnot being gone, and still no horse was announced, no Edmund appeared.', 'Between ten and eleven Edmund and Julia walked into the drawing-room,\r\nfresh with the evening air, glowing and cheerful, the very reverse of\r\nwhat they found in the three ladies sitting there, for Maria would\r\nscarcely raise her eyes from her book, and Lady Bertram was\r\nhalf-asleep; and even Mrs. Norris, discomposed by her niece’s\r\nill-humour, and having asked one or two questions about the dinner,\r\nwhich were not immediately attended to, seemed almost determined to say\r\nno more.', 'Is she gone to bed?”\r\n\r\n“No, not that I know of,” replied Mrs. Norris; “she was here a moment\r\nago.”\r\n\r\nHer own gentle voice speaking from the other end of the room, which was\r\na very long one, told them that she was on the sofa.', 'Mrs. Norris began\r\nscolding.', 'to be sure she did,” said Mrs. Norris: “would you have her\r\nstay within such a fine day as this?', 'Even your\r\nmother was out to-day for above an hour.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed, Edmund,” added her ladyship, who had been thoroughly\r\nawakened by Mrs. Norris’s sharp reprimand to Fanny; “I was out above an\r\nhour.', '_She_ found it hot enough; but they were so full-blown that one could\r\nnot wait.”\r\n\r\n“There was no help for it, certainly,” rejoined Mrs. Norris, in a\r\nrather softened voice; “but I question whether her headache might not\r\nbe caught _then_, sister.', 'No wonder her head aches.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris was talking to Julia, and did not hear.', 'Upon my word, ma’am, it has been\r\na very ill-managed business.”\r\n\r\n“I am sure I do not know how it was to have been done better,” cried\r\nMrs. Norris, unable to be longer deaf; “unless I had gone myself,\r\nindeed; but I cannot be in two places at once; and I was talking to Mr.\r\nGreen at that very time about your mother’s dairymaid, by _her_ desire,\r\nand had promised John Groom to write to Mrs. Jefferies about his son,\r\nand the poor fellow was waiting for me half an hour.', 'Mrs. Norris and her nieces\r\nwere all well pleased with its revival, and an early day was named and\r\nagreed to, provided Mr. Crawford should be disengaged: the young ladies\r\ndid not forget that stipulation, and though Mrs. Norris would willingly\r\nhave answered for his being so, they would neither authorise the\r\nliberty nor run the risk; and at last, on a hint from Miss Bertram, Mr.\r\nRushworth discovered that the properest thing to be done was for him to\r\nwalk down to the Parsonage directly, and call on Mr. Crawford, and\r\ninquire whether Wednesday would suit him or not.', 'It was\r\nhardly possible, indeed, that anything else should be talked of, for\r\nMrs. Norris was in high spirits about it; and Mrs. Rushworth, a\r\nwell-meaning, civil, prosing, pompous woman, who thought nothing of\r\nconsequence, but as it related to her own and her son’s concerns, had\r\nnot yet given over pressing Lady Bertram to be of the party.', 'Lady\r\nBertram constantly declined it; but her placid manner of refusal made\r\nMrs. Rushworth still think she wished to come, till Mrs. Norris’s more\r\nnumerous words and louder tone convinced her of the truth.', 'On his return to the breakfast-room, he found Mrs. Norris trying to\r\nmake up her mind as to whether Miss Crawford’s being of the party were\r\ndesirable or not, or whether her brother’s barouche would not be full\r\nwithout her.', 'After what passed at first, he would claim it as a promise.”\r\n\r\n“And, my dear Edmund,” added Mrs. Norris, “taking out _two_ carriages\r\nwhen _one_ will do, would be trouble for nothing; and, between\r\nourselves, coachman is not very fond of the roads between this and\r\nSotherton: he always complains bitterly of the narrow lanes scratching\r\nhis carriage, and you know one should not like to have dear Sir Thomas,\r\nwhen he comes home, find all the varnish scratched off.”\r\n\r\n“That would not be a very handsome reason for using Mr. Crawford’s,”\r\nsaid Maria; “but the truth is, that Wilcox is a stupid old fellow, and\r\ndoes not know how to drive.', 'Probably Miss Crawford will choose the barouche-box\r\nherself.”\r\n\r\n“There can be no objection, then, to Fanny’s going with you; there can\r\nbe no doubt of your having room for her.”\r\n\r\n“Fanny!” repeated Mrs. Norris; “my dear Edmund, there is no idea of her\r\ngoing with us.', 'very glad, if your aunt sees no objection.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris was very ready with the only objection which could\r\nremain—their having positively assured Mrs. Rushworth that Fanny could\r\nnot go, and the very strange appearance there would consequently be in\r\ntaking her, which seemed to her a difficulty quite impossible to be got\r\nover.', 'Mrs. Norris had no affection\r\nfor Fanny, and no wish of procuring her pleasure at any time; but her\r\nopposition to Edmund _now_, arose more from partiality for her own\r\nscheme, because it _was_ her own, than from anything else.', 'When Edmund, therefore, told her in\r\nreply, as he did when she would give him the hearing, that she need not\r\ndistress herself on Mrs. Rushworth’s account, because he had taken the\r\nopportunity, as he walked with her through the hall, of mentioning Miss\r\nPrice as one who would probably be of the party, and had directly\r\nreceived a very sufficient invitation for his cousin, Mrs. Norris was\r\ntoo much vexed to submit with a very good grace, and would only say,\r\n“Very well, very well, just as you chuse, settle it your own way, I am\r\nsure I do not care about it.”\r\n\r\n“It seems very odd,” said Maria, “that you should be staying at home\r\ninstead of Fanny.”\r\n\r\n“I am sure she ought to be very much obliged to you,” added Julia,\r\nhastily leaving the room as she spoke, from a consciousness that she\r\nought to offer to stay at home herself.', 'Mrs. Norris was all delight and volubility;\r\nand even Fanny had something to say in admiration, and might be heard\r\nwith complacency.', 'It\r\nis past two, and we are to dine at five.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Rushworth submitted; and the question of surveying the grounds,\r\nwith the who and the how, was likely to be more fully agitated, and\r\nMrs. Norris was beginning to arrange by what junction of carriages and\r\nhorses most could be done, when the young people, meeting with an\r\noutward door, temptingly open on a flight of steps which led\r\nimmediately to turf and shrubs, and all the sweets of pleasure-grounds,\r\nas by one impulse, one wish for air and liberty, all walked out.', 'On reaching the bottom of the steps to the terrace, Mrs. Rushworth and\r\nMrs. Norris presented themselves at the top, just ready for the\r\nwilderness, at the end of an hour and a half from their leaving the\r\nhouse.', 'Mrs. Norris had been too well employed to move faster.', 'Dinner was soon followed by tea and coffee, a ten miles’ drive home\r\nallowed no waste of hours; and from the time of their sitting down to\r\ntable, it was a quick succession of busy nothings till the carriage\r\ncame to the door, and Mrs. Norris, having fidgeted about, and obtained\r\na few pheasants’ eggs and a cream cheese from the housekeeper, and made\r\nabundance of civil speeches to Mrs. Rushworth, was ready to lead the\r\nway.', '“Well, Fanny, this has been a fine day for you, upon my word,” said\r\nMrs. Norris, as they drove through the park.', 'And if I have good\r\nluck, your mother shall have some.”\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful evening, mild and still, and the drive was as\r\npleasant as the serenity of Nature could make it; but when Mrs. Norris\r\nceased speaking, it was altogether a silent drive to those within.', 'Mrs. Norris gave the\r\nparticulars of the letters, and the subject was dropt; but after tea,\r\nas Miss Crawford was standing at an open window with Edmund and Fanny\r\nlooking out on a twilight scene, while the Miss Bertrams, Mr.\r\nRushworth, and Henry Crawford were all busy with candles at the\r\npianoforte, she suddenly revived it by turning round towards the group,\r\nand saying, “How happy Mr. Rushworth looks!', 'Fanny sighed alone at the window till scolded away by Mrs. Norris’s\r\nthreats of catching cold.', 'She was privy, one evening, to the hopes of her aunt Norris on\r\nthe subject, as well as to her feelings, and the feelings of Mrs.\r\nRushworth, on a point of some similarity, and could not help wondering\r\nas she listened; and glad would she have been not to be obliged to\r\nlisten, for it was while all the other young people were dancing, and\r\nshe sitting, most unwillingly, among the chaperons at the fire, longing\r\nfor the re-entrance of her elder cousin, on whom all her own hopes of a\r\npartner then depended.', 'While waiting and wishing, looking\r\nnow at the dancers and now at the door, this dialogue between the two\r\nabove-mentioned ladies was forced on her—\r\n\r\n“I think, ma’am,” said Mrs. Norris, her eyes directed towards Mr.\r\nRushworth and Maria, who were partners for the second time, “we shall\r\nsee some happy faces again now.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, ma’am, indeed,” replied the other, with a stately simper, “there\r\nwill be some satisfaction in looking on _now_, and I think it was\r\nrather a pity they should have been obliged to part.', 'Mrs. Norris continued, “It is quite delightful, ma’am, to see young\r\npeople so properly happy, so well suited, and so much the thing!', 'I shall speak to my sisters and try to dissuade _them_,\r\nand that is all I can do.”\r\n\r\n“I should think my aunt Norris would be on your side.”\r\n\r\n“I dare say she would, but she has no influence with either Tom or my\r\nsisters that could be of any use; and if I cannot convince them myself,\r\nI shall let things take their course, without attempting it through\r\nher.', 'Opposition was vain; and as to Mrs. Norris, he was\r\nmistaken in supposing she would wish to make any.', 'An enormous roll of green baize had arrived from\r\nNorthampton, and been cut out by Mrs. Norris (with a saving by her good\r\nmanagement of full three-quarters of a yard), and was actually forming\r\ninto a curtain by the housemaids, and still the play was wanting; and\r\nas two or three days passed away in this manner, Edmund began almost to\r\nhope that none might ever be found.', 'No; you must excuse me; I\r\ncannot retract my consent; it is too far settled, everybody would be so\r\ndisappointed, Tom would be quite angry; and if we are so very nice, we\r\nshall never act anything.”\r\n\r\n“I was just going to say the very same thing,” said Mrs. Norris.', 'Mrs. Norris related again her triumph over Dick\r\nJackson, but neither play nor preparation were otherwise much talked\r\nof, for Edmund’s disapprobation was felt even by his brother, though he\r\nwould not have owned it.', 'The actors may be glad, but the bystanders must be\r\ninfinitely more thankful for a decision; and I do sincerely give you\r\njoy, madam, as well as Mrs. Norris, and everybody else who is in the\r\nsame predicament,” glancing half fearfully, half slyly, beyond Fanny to\r\nEdmund.', 'It must\r\nbe very difficult to keep Anhalt from appearing a formal, solemn\r\nlecturer; and the man who chuses the profession itself is, perhaps, one\r\nof the last who would wish to represent it on the stage.”\r\n\r\nMiss Crawford was silenced, and with some feelings of resentment and\r\nmortification, moved her chair considerably nearer the tea-table, and\r\ngave all her attention to Mrs. Norris, who was presiding there.', 'Her\r\nentreaty had no effect on Tom: he only said again what he had said\r\nbefore; and it was not merely Tom, for the requisition was now backed\r\nby Maria, and Mr. Crawford, and Mr. Yates, with an urgency which\r\ndiffered from his but in being more gentle or more ceremonious, and\r\nwhich altogether was quite overpowering to Fanny; and before she could\r\nbreathe after it, Mrs. Norris completed the whole by thus addressing\r\nher in a whisper at once angry and audible—“What a piece of work here\r\nis about nothing: I am quite ashamed of you, Fanny, to make such a\r\ndifficulty of obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort—so kind as\r\nthey are to you!', 'Do not urge her any more.”\r\n\r\n“I am not going to urge her,” replied Mrs. Norris sharply; “but I shall\r\nthink her a very obstinate, ungrateful girl, if she does not do what\r\nher aunt and cousins wish her—very ungrateful, indeed, considering who\r\nand what she is.”\r\n\r\nEdmund was too angry to speak; but Miss Crawford, looking for a moment\r\nwith astonished eyes at Mrs. Norris, and then at Fanny, whose tears\r\nwere beginning to shew themselves, immediately said, with some\r\nkeenness, “I do not like my situation: this _place_ is too hot for me,”\r\nand moved away her chair to the opposite side of the table, close to\r\nFanny, saying to her, in a kind, low whisper, as she placed herself,\r\n“Never mind, my dear Miss Price, this is a cross evening: everybody is\r\ncross and teasing, but do not let us mind them”; and with pointed\r\nattention continued to talk to her and endeavour to raise her spirits,\r\nin spite of being out of spirits herself.', 'The East room, as it had been called\r\never since Maria Bertram was sixteen, was now considered Fanny’s,\r\nalmost as decidedly as the white attic: the smallness of the one making\r\nthe use of the other so evidently reasonable that the Miss Bertrams,\r\nwith every superiority in their own apartments which their own sense of\r\nsuperiority could demand, were entirely approving it; and Mrs. Norris,\r\nhaving stipulated for there never being a fire in it on Fanny’s\r\naccount, was tolerably resigned to her having the use of what nobody\r\nelse wanted, though the terms in which she sometimes spoke of the\r\nindulgence seemed to imply that it was the best room in the house.', 'Mrs. Norris offered to contrive his\r\ndress, Mr. Yates assured him that Anhalt’s last scene with the Baron\r\nadmitted a good deal of action and emphasis, and Mr. Rushworth\r\nundertook to count his speeches.', 'Edmund, between his theatrical and his real\r\npart, between Miss Crawford’s claims and his own conduct, between love\r\nand consistency, was equally unobservant; and Mrs. Norris was too busy\r\nin contriving and directing the general little matters of the company,\r\nsuperintending their various dresses with economical expedient, for\r\nwhich nobody thanked her, and saving, with delighted integrity, half a\r\ncrown here and there to the absent Sir Thomas, to have leisure for\r\nwatching the behaviour, or guarding the happiness of his daughters.', 'There was a great deal of needlework to be done, moreover, in which her\r\nhelp was wanted; and that Mrs. Norris thought her quite as well off as\r\nthe rest, was evident by the manner in which she claimed it—“Come,\r\nFanny,” she cried, “these are fine times for you, but you must not be\r\nalways walking from one room to the other, and doing the lookings-on at\r\nyour ease, in this way; I want you here.', 'It is about Lovers’ Vows.”\r\n\r\n“I believe,” said Fanny to her aunt Bertram, “there will be three acts\r\nrehearsed to-morrow evening, and that will give you an opportunity of\r\nseeing all the actors at once.”\r\n\r\n“You had better stay till the curtain is hung,” interposed Mrs. Norris;\r\n“the curtain will be hung in a day or two—there is very little sense in\r\na play without a curtain—and I am much mistaken if you do not find it\r\ndraw up into very handsome festoons.”\r\n\r\nLady Bertram seemed quite resigned to waiting.', 'All were alert and impatient; the ladies moved soon, the\r\ngentlemen soon followed them, and with the exception of Lady Bertram,\r\nMrs. Norris, and Julia, everybody was in the theatre at an early hour;\r\nand having lighted it up as well as its unfinished state admitted, were\r\nwaiting only the arrival of Mrs. Grant and the Crawfords to begin.', 'Mrs. Norris was by no means to be compared in happiness to her sister.', 'Mrs. Norris felt herself defrauded of an office on which\r\nshe had always depended, whether his arrival or his death were to be\r\nthe thing unfolded; and was now trying to be in a bustle without having\r\nanything to bustle about, and labouring to be important where nothing\r\nwas wanted but tranquillity and silence.', '“Still the same anxiety for\r\neverybody’s comfort, my dear Mrs. Norris,” was his answer.', 'He could not help\r\ngiving Mrs. Norris a hint of his having hoped that her advice might\r\nhave been interposed to prevent what her judgment must certainly have\r\ndisapproved.', 'Mrs. Norris was a little confounded and as\r\nnearly being silenced as ever she had been in her life; for she was\r\nashamed to confess having never seen any of the impropriety which was\r\nso glaring to Sir Thomas, and would not have admitted that her\r\ninfluence was insufficient—that she might have talked in vain.', '‘Upon my\r\nword, Mrs. Norris,’ said Mrs. Grant the other day, ‘if Mr. Rushworth\r\nwere a son of your own, he could not hold Sir Thomas in greater\r\nrespect.’”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas gave up the point, foiled by her evasions, disarmed by her\r\nflattery; and was obliged to rest satisfied with the conviction that\r\nwhere the present pleasure of those she loved was at stake, her\r\nkindness did sometimes overpower her judgment.', 'Mrs. Norris began to look about her,\r\nand wonder that his falling in love with Julia had come to nothing; and\r\ncould almost fear that she had been remiss herself in forwarding it;\r\nbut with so many to care for, how was it possible for even _her_\r\nactivity to keep pace with her wishes?', 'Mrs. Norris contrived to remove one article from his sight that might\r\nhave distressed him.', 'Mrs. Norris, most happy to assist in the duties of the day, by spending\r\nit at the Park to support her sister’s spirits, and drinking the health\r\nof Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth in a supernumerary glass or two, was all\r\njoyous delight; for she had made the match; she had done everything;\r\nand no one would have supposed, from her confident triumph, that she\r\nhad ever heard of conjugal infelicity in her life, or could have the\r\nsmallest insight into the disposition of the niece who had been brought\r\nup under her eye.', 'As to anxiety for any alarm that her absence in such\r\nweather might occasion at home, she had nothing to suffer on that\r\nscore; for as her being out was known only to her two aunts, she was\r\nperfectly aware that none would be felt, and that in whatever cottage\r\naunt Norris might chuse to establish her during the rain, her being in\r\nsuch cottage would be indubitable to aunt Bertram.', 'She had neither sympathy nor\r\nassistance from those who ought to have entered into her feelings and\r\ndirected her taste; for Lady Bertram never thought of being useful to\r\nanybody, and Mrs. Norris, when she came on the morrow, in consequence\r\nof an early call and invitation from Sir Thomas, was in a very ill\r\nhumour, and seemed intent only on lessening her niece’s pleasure, both\r\npresent and future, as much as possible.', 'Mrs. Grant thinks it a civility due to\r\n_us_ to take a little notice of you, or else it would never have come\r\ninto her head, and you may be very certain that, if your cousin Julia\r\nhad been at home, you would not have been asked at all.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris had now so ingeniously done away all Mrs. Grant’s part of\r\nthe favour, that Fanny, who found herself expected to speak, could only\r\nsay that she was very much obliged to her aunt Bertram for sparing her,\r\nand that she was endeavouring to put her aunt’s evening work in such a\r\nstate as to prevent her being missed.', 'However, you will have dinner enough on it for ten, I\r\ndare say.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris fetched breath, and went on again.', 'She rated her own claims to\r\ncomfort as low even as Mrs. Norris could; and when Sir Thomas soon\r\nafterwards, just opening the door, said, “Fanny, at what time would you\r\nhave the carriage come round?” she felt a degree of astonishment which\r\nmade it impossible for her to speak.', '“My dear Sir Thomas!” cried Mrs. Norris, red with anger, “Fanny can\r\nwalk.”\r\n\r\n“Walk!” repeated Sir Thomas, in a tone of most unanswerable dignity,\r\nand coming farther into the room.', 'Will twenty minutes after four suit you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” was Fanny’s humble answer, given with the feelings almost\r\nof a criminal towards Mrs. Norris; and not bearing to remain with her\r\nin what might seem a state of triumph, she followed her uncle out of\r\nthe room, having staid behind him only long enough to hear these words\r\nspoken in angry agitation—\r\n\r\n“Quite unnecessary!', 'She was soon aware of this herself; for\r\nthough she must submit, as her own propriety of mind directed, in spite\r\nof her aunt Norris’s opinion, to being the principal lady in company,\r\nand to all the little distinctions consequent thereon, she found, while\r\nthey were at table, such a happy flow of conversation prevailing, in\r\nwhich she was not required to take any part—there was so much to be\r\nsaid between the brother and sister about Bath, so much between the two\r\nyoung men about hunting, so much of politics between Mr. Crawford and\r\nDr. Grant, and of everything and all together between Mr. Crawford and\r\nMrs. Grant, as to leave her the fairest prospect of having only to\r\nlisten in quiet, and of passing a very agreeable day.', 'This was\r\nexactly what Sir Thomas and Edmund had been separately conniving at, as\r\neach proved to the other by the sympathetic alacrity with which they\r\nboth advised Mrs. Norris’s continuing where she was, instead of rushing\r\nout into the hall as soon as the noises of the arrival reached them.', 'Excepting the moments of peculiar delight, which any marked or\r\nunlooked-for instance of Edmund’s consideration of her in the last few\r\nmonths had excited, Fanny had never known so much felicity in her life,\r\nas in this unchecked, equal, fearless intercourse with the brother and\r\nfriend who was opening all his heart to her, telling her all his hopes\r\nand fears, plans, and solicitudes respecting that long thought of,\r\ndearly earned, and justly valued blessing of promotion; who could give\r\nher direct and minute information of the father and mother, brothers\r\nand sisters, of whom she very seldom heard; who was interested in all\r\nthe comforts and all the little hardships of her home at Mansfield;\r\nready to think of every member of that home as she directed, or\r\ndiffering only by a less scrupulous opinion, and more noisy abuse of\r\ntheir aunt Norris, and with whom (perhaps the dearest indulgence of the\r\nwhole) all the evil and good of their earliest years could be gone over\r\nagain, and every former united pain and pleasure retraced with the\r\nfondest recollection.', 'With such means in his power he had a right to be listened to; and\r\nthough Mrs. Norris could fidget about the room, and disturb everybody\r\nin quest of two needlefuls of thread or a second-hand shirt button, in\r\nthe midst of her nephew’s account of a shipwreck or an engagement,\r\neverybody else was attentive; and even Lady Bertram could not hear of\r\nsuch horrors unmoved, or without sometimes lifting her eyes from her\r\nwork to say, “Dear me!', 'The meeting was generally felt to be a pleasant one, being composed in\r\na good proportion of those who would talk and those who would listen;\r\nand the dinner itself was elegant and plentiful, according to the usual\r\nstyle of the Grants, and too much according to the usual habits of all\r\nto raise any emotion except in Mrs. Norris, who could never behold\r\neither the wide table or the number of dishes on it with patience, and\r\nwho did always contrive to experience some evil from the passing of the\r\nservants behind her chair, and to bring away some fresh conviction of\r\nits being impossible among so many dishes but that some must be cold.', 'Do not think of me as I appeared then.”\r\n\r\nSotherton was a word to catch Mrs. Norris, and being just then in the\r\nhappy leisure which followed securing the odd trick by Sir Thomas’s\r\ncapital play and her own against Dr. and Mrs. Grant’s great hands, she\r\ncalled out, in high good-humour, “Sotherton!', 'I do not exactly\r\nknow the distance, but when you get back to Portsmouth, if it is not\r\nvery far off, you ought to go over and pay your respects to them; and I\r\ncould send a little parcel by you that I want to get conveyed to your\r\ncousins.”\r\n\r\n“I should be very happy, aunt; but Brighton is almost by Beachey Head;\r\nand if I could get so far, I could not expect to be welcome in such a\r\nsmart place as that—poor scrubby midshipman as I am.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris was beginning an eager assurance of the affability he might\r\ndepend on, when she was stopped by Sir Thomas’s saying with authority,\r\n“I do not advise your going to Brighton, William, as I trust you may\r\nsoon have more convenient opportunities of meeting; but my daughters\r\nwould be happy to see their cousins anywhere; and you will find Mr.\r\nRushworth most sincerely disposed to regard all the connexions of our\r\nfamily as his own.”\r\n\r\n“I would rather find him private secretary to the First Lord than\r\nanything else,” was William’s only answer, in an undervoice, not meant\r\nto reach far, and the subject dropped.', 'As yet Sir Thomas had seen nothing to remark in Mr. Crawford’s\r\nbehaviour; but when the whist-table broke up at the end of the second\r\nrubber, and leaving Dr. Grant and Mrs. Norris to dispute over their\r\nlast play, he became a looker-on at the other, he found his niece the\r\nobject of attentions, or rather of professions, of a somewhat pointed\r\ncharacter.', 'He passed, however, for an admirer of her dancing; and Sir Thomas, by\r\nno means displeased, prolonged the conversation on dancing in general,\r\nand was so well engaged in describing the balls of Antigua, and\r\nlistening to what his nephew could relate of the different modes of\r\ndancing which had fallen within his observation, that he had not heard\r\nhis carriage announced, and was first called to the knowledge of it by\r\nthe bustle of Mrs. Norris.', 'My dear\r\nSir Thomas, we have settled it that the carriage should come back for\r\nyou, and Edmund and William.”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas could not dissent, as it had been his own arrangement,\r\npreviously communicated to his wife and sister; but _that_ seemed\r\nforgotten by Mrs. Norris, who must fancy that she settled it all\r\nherself.', 'A dance at home would\r\nbe more eligible; and if—”\r\n\r\n“Ah, my dear Sir Thomas!” interrupted Mrs. Norris, “I knew what was\r\ncoming.', 'Could we be all\r\nassembled, our satisfaction would undoubtedly be more complete, but the\r\nabsence of some is not to debar the others of amusement.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris had not another word to say.', 'Sir Thomas engaged for its giving her very little\r\ntrouble; and she assured him “that she was not at all afraid of the\r\ntrouble; indeed, she could not imagine there would be any.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris was ready with her suggestions as to the rooms he would\r\nthink fittest to be used, but found it all prearranged; and when she\r\nwould have conjectured and hinted about the day, it appeared that the\r\nday was settled too.', 'Mrs. Norris was obliged to be satisfied with thinking just the\r\nsame, and with having been on the point of proposing the 22nd herself,\r\nas by far the best day for the purpose.', 'She had some extra\r\nvisits from the housekeeper, and her maid was rather hurried in making\r\nup a new dress for her: Sir Thomas gave orders, and Mrs. Norris ran\r\nabout; but all this gave _her_ no trouble, and as she had foreseen,\r\n“there was, in fact, no trouble in the business.”\r\n\r\nEdmund was at this time particularly full of cares: his mind being\r\ndeeply occupied in the consideration of two important events now at\r\nhand, which were to fix his fate in life—ordination and\r\nmatrimony—events of such a serious character as to make the ball, which\r\nwould be very quickly followed by one of them, appear of less moment in\r\nhis eyes than in those of any other person in the house.', 'To dance without much observation or any\r\nextraordinary fatigue, to have strength and partners for about half the\r\nevening, to dance a little with Edmund, and not a great deal with Mr.\r\nCrawford, to see William enjoy himself, and be able to keep away from\r\nher aunt Norris, was the height of her ambition, and seemed to\r\ncomprehend her greatest possibility of happiness.', 'William, determined to\r\nmake this last day a day of thorough enjoyment, was out snipe-shooting;\r\nEdmund, she had too much reason to suppose, was at the Parsonage; and\r\nleft alone to bear the worrying of Mrs. Norris, who was cross because\r\nthe housekeeper would have her own way with the supper, and whom _she_\r\ncould not avoid though the housekeeper might, Fanny was worn down at\r\nlast to think everything an evil belonging to the ball, and when sent\r\noff with a parting worry to dress, moved as languidly towards her own\r\nroom, and felt as incapable of happiness as if she had been allowed no\r\nshare in it.', 'Oh, yes!” cried Mrs. Norris, “she has good reason to look\r\nwell with all her advantages: brought up in this family as she has\r\nbeen, with all the benefit of her cousins’ manners before her.', 'Her cousins’ former gaiety on the day of a ball was no longer\r\nsurprising to her; she felt it to be indeed very charming, and was\r\nactually practising her steps about the drawing-room as long as she\r\ncould be safe from the notice of her aunt Norris, who was entirely\r\ntaken up at first in fresh arranging and injuring the noble fire which\r\nthe butler had prepared.', 'It was but\r\nto think of her conversation with Edmund, and what was the restlessness\r\nof Mrs. Norris?', 'Sir Thomas himself was watching\r\nher progress down the dance with much complacency; he was proud of his\r\nniece; and without attributing all her personal beauty, as Mrs. Norris\r\nseemed to do, to her transplantation to Mansfield, he was pleased with\r\nhimself for having supplied everything else: education and manners she\r\nowed to him.', 'Miss Crawford knew Mrs. Norris too well to think of gratifying _her_ by\r\ncommendation of Fanny; to her, it was as the occasion offered—“Ah!', 'ma’am, how much we want dear Mrs. Rushworth and Julia to-night!” and\r\nMrs. Norris paid her with as many smiles and courteous words as she had\r\ntime for, amid so much occupation as she found for herself in making up\r\ncard-tables, giving hints to Sir Thomas, and trying to move all the\r\nchaperons to a better part of the room.', 'She would much rather _not_ have been asked by him again so\r\nvery soon, and she wished she had not been obliged to suspect that his\r\nprevious inquiries of Mrs. Norris, about the supper hour, were all for\r\nthe sake of securing her at that part of the evening.', 'Fanny’s disposition was such that she could never even think of her\r\naunt Norris in the meagreness and cheerlessness of her own small house,\r\nwithout reproaching herself for some little want of attention to her\r\nwhen they had been last together; much less could her feelings acquit\r\nher of having done and said and thought everything by William that was\r\ndue to him for a whole fortnight.', 'It was only better than Mrs. Norris’s sharp answers would have\r\nbeen; but she being gone home with all the supernumerary jellies to\r\nnurse a sick maid, there was peace and good-humour in their little\r\nparty, though it could not boast much beside.', 'She opened her\r\nnote immediately, glad to have anything to do, and happy, as she read\r\nit, to feel that the fidgetings of her aunt Norris, who was also to\r\ndine there, screened her a little from view.', 'Mrs. Norris seemed as much delighted with the saving it would be to Sir\r\nThomas as with any part of it.', 'She knew he must be at some expense, that he would have many\r\nthings to buy, though to be sure his father and mother would be able to\r\nput him in the way of getting everything very cheap; but she was very\r\nglad she had contributed her mite towards it.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad you gave him something considerable,” said Lady Bertram,\r\nwith most unsuspicious calmness, “for _I_ gave him only £10.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!” cried Mrs. Norris, reddening.', '“Upon my word, he must have\r\ngone off with his pockets well lined, and at no expense for his journey\r\nto London either!”\r\n\r\n“Sir Thomas told me £10 would be enough.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris, being not at all inclined to question its sufficiency,\r\nbegan to take the matter in another point.', 'She\r\nfancied he was trying for it the whole evening at intervals, whenever\r\nSir Thomas was out of the room, or at all engaged with Mrs. Norris, and\r\nshe carefully refused him every opportunity.', 'His coming might have nothing to do with her, but\r\nshe must avoid seeing him if possible; and being then on her way\r\nupstairs, she resolved there to remain, during the whole of his visit,\r\nunless actually sent for; and as Mrs. Norris was still in the house,\r\nthere seemed little danger of her being wanted.', 'Your aunt cannot be aware of this.”\r\n\r\nFanny would rather have been silent; but being obliged to speak, she\r\ncould not forbear, in justice to the aunt she loved best, from saying\r\nsomething in which the words “my aunt Norris” were distinguishable.', 'Your aunt Norris has always been an\r\nadvocate, and very judiciously, for young people’s being brought up\r\nwithout unnecessary indulgences; but there should be moderation in\r\neverything.', 'I am sure you will not disappoint my opinion of you, by\r\nfailing at any time to treat your aunt Norris with the respect and\r\nattention that are due to her.', 'Not to excite suspicion by her look or manner was now an object worth\r\nattaining; and she felt equal to almost anything that might save her\r\nfrom her aunt Norris.', '“Heaven defend me from being ungrateful!”\r\n\r\nShe saw nothing more of her uncle, nor of her aunt Norris, till they\r\nmet at dinner.', '“Oh!” said Mrs. Norris, with a moment’s check, “that was very kind of\r\nyou, Sir Thomas; but you do not know how dry the path is to my house.', 'If she would but have let us know she was going out but there is\r\na something about Fanny, I have often observed it before—she likes to\r\ngo her own way to work; she does not like to be dictated to; she takes\r\nher own independent walk whenever she can; she certainly has a little\r\nspirit of secrecy, and independence, and nonsense, about her, which I\r\nwould advise her to get the better of.”\r\n\r\nAs a general reflection on Fanny, Sir Thomas thought nothing could be\r\nmore unjust, though he had been so lately expressing the same\r\nsentiments himself, and he tried to turn the conversation: tried\r\nrepeatedly before he could succeed; for Mrs. Norris had not discernment\r\nenough to perceive, either now, or at any other time, to what degree he\r\nthought well of his niece, or how very far he was from wishing to have\r\nhis own children’s merits set off by the depreciation of hers.', 'While Fanny’s mind was engaged in these sort of hopes, her uncle was,\r\nsoon after tea, called out of the room; an occurrence too common to\r\nstrike her, and she thought nothing of it till the butler reappeared\r\nten minutes afterwards, and advancing decidedly towards herself, said,\r\n“Sir Thomas wishes to speak with you, ma’am, in his own room.” Then it\r\noccurred to her what might be going on; a suspicion rushed over her\r\nmind which drove the colour from her cheeks; but instantly rising, she\r\nwas preparing to obey, when Mrs. Norris called out, “Stay, stay, Fanny!', '“No, ma’am, it is Miss Price; I am certain of\r\nits being Miss Price.” And there was a half-smile with the words, which\r\nmeant, “I do not think you would answer the purpose at all.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Norris, much discontented, was obliged to compose herself to work\r\nagain; and Fanny, walking off in agitating consciousness, found\r\nherself, as she anticipated, in another minute alone with Mr. Crawford.', 'When Sir Thomas understood this, he felt the necessity\r\nof making his own wife and sister-in-law acquainted with the business\r\nwithout delay; though, on Fanny’s account, he almost dreaded the effect\r\nof the communication to Mrs. Norris as much as Fanny herself.', 'Sir Thomas, indeed, was,\r\nby this time, not very far from classing Mrs. Norris as one of those\r\nwell-meaning people who are always doing mistaken and very disagreeable\r\nthings.', 'Mrs. Norris, however, relieved him.', 'And as to the\r\nnot missing her, which under Mrs. Norris’s discussion was the point\r\nattempted to be proved, she set herself very steadily against admitting\r\nany such thing.', 'But Mrs. Norris wanted to persuade her that Fanny could be\r\nvery well spared—_she_ being ready to give up all her own time to her\r\nas requested—and, in short, could not really be wanted or missed.', 'Mrs. Norris was left to settle the matter by herself; and it\r\nended, to the infinite joy of her nephew and niece, in the recollection\r\nthat she could not possibly be spared from Mansfield Park at present;\r\nthat she was a great deal too necessary to Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram\r\nfor her to be able to answer it to herself to leave them even for a\r\nweek, and therefore must certainly sacrifice every other pleasure to\r\nthat of being useful to them.', 'Aunt Norris lives too far off to think of such little people\r\nas you.”\r\n\r\nFanny had indeed nothing to convey from aunt Norris, but a message to\r\nsay she hoped that her god-daughter was a good girl, and learnt her\r\nbook.', 'Mrs. Norris, however, had gone home\r\nand taken down two old prayer-books of her husband with that idea; but,\r\nupon examination, the ardour of generosity went off.', 'Of her two sisters, Mrs. Price very much more resembled Lady Bertram\r\nthan Mrs. Norris.', 'She might have made\r\njust as good a woman of consequence as Lady Bertram, but Mrs. Norris\r\nwould have been a more respectable mother of nine children on a small\r\nincome.', 'If tenderness could be ever\r\nsupposed wanting, good sense and good breeding supplied its place; and\r\nas to the little irritations sometimes introduced by aunt Norris, they\r\nwere short, they were trifling, they were as a drop of water to the\r\nocean, compared with the ceaseless tumult of her present abode.', 'Three\r\nor four Prices might have been swept away, any or all except Fanny and\r\nWilliam, and Lady Bertram would have thought little about it; or\r\nperhaps might have caught from Mrs. Norris’s lips the cant of its being\r\na very happy thing and a great blessing to their poor dear sister Price\r\nto have them so well provided for.', 'Mrs. Norris, however, as most attached to Maria, was\r\nreally the greatest sufferer.', 'Edmund was almost as welcome\r\nto his brother as Fanny to her aunt; but Mrs. Norris, instead of having\r\ncomfort from either, was but the more irritated by the sight of the\r\nperson whom, in the blindness of her anger, she could have charged as\r\nthe daemon of the piece.', 'Lady Bertram could not give her\r\nmuch time, or many words, but she felt her, as Fanny’s sister, to have\r\na claim at Mansfield, and was ready to kiss and like her; and Susan was\r\nmore than satisfied, for she came perfectly aware that nothing but\r\nill-humour was to be expected from aunt Norris; and was so provided\r\nwith happiness, so strong in that best of blessings, an escape from\r\nmany certain evils, that she could have stood against a great deal more\r\nindifference than she met with from the others.', 'His displeasure\r\nagainst herself she trusted, reasoning differently from Mrs. Norris,\r\nwould now be done away.', 'He saw how ill he had judged, in expecting to counteract what\r\nwas wrong in Mrs. Norris by its reverse in himself; clearly saw that he\r\nhad but increased the evil by teaching them to repress their spirits in\r\nhis presence so as to make their real disposition unknown to him, and\r\nsending them for all their indulgences to a person who had been able to\r\nattach them only by the blindness of her affection, and the excess of\r\nher praise.', 'Mrs. Norris, whose attachment seemed to augment\r\nwith the demerits of her niece, would have had her received at home and\r\ncountenanced by them all.', 'It ended in Mrs. Norris’s resolving to quit Mansfield and devote\r\nherself to her unfortunate Maria, and in an establishment being formed\r\nfor them in another country, remote and private, where, shut up\r\ntogether with little society, on one side no affection, on the other no\r\njudgment, it may be reasonably supposed that their tempers became their\r\nmutual punishment.', 'Mrs. Norris’s removal from Mansfield was the great supplementary\r\ncomfort of Sir Thomas’s life.', 'Not even Fanny had tears for aunt Norris, not\r\neven when she was gone for ever.']

['MANSFIELD PARK\r\n\r\n(1814)\r\n\r\nBy Jane Austen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout thirty years ago Miss Maria Ward, of Huntingdon, with only seven\r\nthousand pounds, had the good luck to captivate Sir Thomas Bertram, of\r\nMansfield Park, in the county of Northampton, and to be thereby raised\r\nto the rank of a baronet’s lady, with all the comforts and consequences\r\nof an handsome house and large income.', 'She had two sisters to be benefited by her elevation; and such of\r\ntheir acquaintance as thought Miss Ward and Miss Frances quite as\r\nhandsome as Miss Maria, did not scruple to predict their marrying with\r\nalmost equal advantage.', 'Julia\r\nBertram was only twelve, and Maria but a year older.', 'or had she quarrelled with Maria and Julia?', 'He had never knowingly given her pain, but he now felt that\r\nshe required more positive kindness; and with that view endeavoured, in\r\nthe first place, to lessen her fears of them all, and gave her\r\nespecially a great deal of good advice as to playing with Maria and\r\nJulia, and being as merry as possible.', 'There was no positive ill-nature in Maria or Julia; and though\r\nFanny was often mortified by their treatment of her, she thought too\r\nlowly of her own claims to feel injured by it.', '“If poor Sir Thomas were fated never\r\nto return, it would be peculiarly consoling to see their dear Maria\r\nwell married,” she very often thought; always when they were in the\r\ncompany of men of fortune, and particularly on the introduction of a\r\nyoung man who had recently succeeded to one of the largest estates and\r\nfinest places in the country.', 'Her figure is as neat as her brother’s.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” added Maria, “and her spirits are as good, and she has the same\r\nenergy of character.', 'Between ten and eleven Edmund and Julia walked into the drawing-room,\r\nfresh with the evening air, glowing and cheerful, the very reverse of\r\nwhat they found in the three ladies sitting there, for Maria would\r\nscarcely raise her eyes from her book, and Lady Bertram was\r\nhalf-asleep; and even Mrs. Norris, discomposed by her niece’s\r\nill-humour, and having asked one or two questions about the dinner,\r\nwhich were not immediately attended to, seemed almost determined to say\r\nno more.', 'No, my dear Edmund, that\r\nwill not quite do.”\r\n\r\n“Besides,” said Maria, “I know that Mr. Crawford depends upon taking\r\nus.', 'After what passed at first, he would claim it as a promise.”\r\n\r\n“And, my dear Edmund,” added Mrs. Norris, “taking out _two_ carriages\r\nwhen _one_ will do, would be trouble for nothing; and, between\r\nourselves, coachman is not very fond of the roads between this and\r\nSotherton: he always complains bitterly of the narrow lanes scratching\r\nhis carriage, and you know one should not like to have dear Sir Thomas,\r\nwhen he comes home, find all the varnish scratched off.”\r\n\r\n“That would not be a very handsome reason for using Mr. Crawford’s,”\r\nsaid Maria; “but the truth is, that Wilcox is a stupid old fellow, and\r\ndoes not know how to drive.', 'I will answer for it that we shall find no\r\ninconvenience from narrow roads on Wednesday.”\r\n\r\n“There is no hardship, I suppose, nothing unpleasant,” said Edmund, “in\r\ngoing on the barouche box.”\r\n\r\n“Unpleasant!” cried Maria: “oh dear!', 'When Edmund, therefore, told her in\r\nreply, as he did when she would give him the hearing, that she need not\r\ndistress herself on Mrs. Rushworth’s account, because he had taken the\r\nopportunity, as he walked with her through the hall, of mentioning Miss\r\nPrice as one who would probably be of the party, and had directly\r\nreceived a very sufficient invitation for his cousin, Mrs. Norris was\r\ntoo much vexed to submit with a very good grace, and would only say,\r\n“Very well, very well, just as you chuse, settle it your own way, I am\r\nsure I do not care about it.”\r\n\r\n“It seems very odd,” said Maria, “that you should be staying at home\r\ninstead of Fanny.”\r\n\r\n“I am sure she ought to be very much obliged to you,” added Julia,\r\nhastily leaving the room as she spoke, from a consciousness that she\r\nought to offer to stay at home herself.', 'Unhappy Maria!', 'One\r\nwishes it were not so; but I have not yet left Oxford long enough to\r\nforget what chapel prayers are.”\r\n\r\nWhile this was passing, the rest of the party being scattered about the\r\nchapel, Julia called Mr. Crawford’s attention to her sister, by saying,\r\n“Do look at Mr. Rushworth and Maria, standing side by side, exactly as\r\nif the ceremony were going to be performed.', 'Have not they completely\r\nthe air of it?”\r\n\r\nMr. Crawford smiled his acquiescence, and stepping forward to Maria,\r\nsaid, in a voice which she only could hear, “I do not like to see Miss\r\nBertram so near the altar.”\r\n\r\nStarting, the lady instinctively moved a step or two, but recovering\r\nherself in a moment, affected to laugh, and asked him, in a tone not\r\nmuch louder, “If he would give her away?”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid I should do it very awkwardly,” was his reply, with a look\r\nof meaning.', 'How unlucky that\r\nyou are not ordained; Mr. Rushworth and Maria are quite ready.”\r\n\r\nMiss Crawford’s countenance, as Julia spoke, might have amused a\r\ndisinterested observer.', 'I thought Maria and Mr. Crawford were with you.”\r\n\r\nFanny explained.', '“But they cannot be very far off, and I think I\r\nam equal to as much as Maria, even without help.”\r\n\r\n“But, Julia, Mr. Rushworth will be here in a moment with the key.', 'He was posting away as if upon life and death,\r\nand could but just spare time to tell us his errand, and where you all\r\nwere.”\r\n\r\n“It is a pity he should have so much trouble for nothing.”\r\n\r\n“_That_ is Miss Maria’s concern.', '“They desired me to stay—my cousin Maria charged me to say that you\r\nwould find them at that knoll, or thereabouts.”\r\n\r\n“I do not believe I shall go any farther,” said he sullenly; “I see\r\nnothing of them.', 'Now I can manage the other parcel and the basket very well.”\r\n\r\n“What else have you been spunging?” said Maria, half-pleased that\r\nSotherton should be so complimented.', 'My other sacrifice, of course, you do not understand.”\r\n\r\n“My taking orders, I assure you, is quite as voluntary as Maria’s\r\nmarrying.”\r\n\r\n“It is fortunate that your inclination and your father’s convenience\r\nshould accord so well.', 'Julia might be\r\njustified in so doing by the hints of Mrs. Grant, inclined to credit\r\nwhat she wished, and Maria by the hints of Mr. Crawford himself.', 'Crawford has too much sense to stay here if he found\r\nhimself in any danger from Maria; and I am not at all afraid for her,\r\nafter such a proof as she has given that her feelings are not strong.”\r\n\r\nFanny supposed she must have been mistaken, and meant to think\r\ndifferently in future; but with all that submission to Edmund could do,\r\nand all the help of the coinciding looks and hints which she\r\noccasionally noticed in some of the others, and which seemed to say\r\nthat Julia was Mr. Crawford’s choice, she knew not always what to\r\nthink.', 'While waiting and wishing, looking\r\nnow at the dancers and now at the door, this dialogue between the two\r\nabove-mentioned ladies was forced on her—\r\n\r\n“I think, ma’am,” said Mrs. Norris, her eyes directed towards Mr.\r\nRushworth and Maria, who were partners for the second time, “we shall\r\nsee some happy faces again now.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, ma’am, indeed,” replied the other, with a stately simper, “there\r\nwill be some satisfaction in looking on _now_, and I think it was\r\nrather a pity they should have been obliged to part.', 'For mere amusement\r\namong ourselves we should want nothing more.”\r\n\r\n“I believe we must be satisfied with _less_,” said Maria.', 'It would shew great want of feeling on\r\nmy father’s account, absent as he is, and in some degree of constant\r\ndanger; and it would be imprudent, I think, with regard to Maria, whose\r\nsituation is a very delicate one, considering everything, extremely\r\ndelicate.”\r\n\r\n“You take up a thing so seriously!', 'Julia _did_ seem inclined to\r\nadmit that Maria’s situation might require particular caution and\r\ndelicacy—but that could not extend to _her_—she was at liberty; and\r\nMaria evidently considered her engagement as only raising her so much\r\nmore above restraint, and leaving her less occasion than Julia to\r\nconsult either father or mother.', 'Three of the characters were now cast, besides Mr.\r\nRushworth, who was always answered for by Maria as willing to do\r\nanything; when Julia, meaning, like her sister, to be Agatha, began to\r\nbe scrupulous on Miss Crawford’s account.', 'Amelia and Agatha may do for Maria and me, but here is\r\nnothing for your sister, Mr. Crawford.”\r\n\r\nMr. Crawford desired _that_ might not be thought of: he was very sure\r\nhis sister had no wish of acting but as she might be useful, and that\r\nshe would not allow herself to be considered in the present case.', 'She saw a glance at Maria which confirmed\r\nthe injury to herself: it was a scheme, a trick; she was slighted,\r\nMaria was preferred; the smile of triumph which Maria was trying to\r\nsuppress shewed how well it was understood; and before Julia could\r\ncommand herself enough to speak, her brother gave his weight against\r\nher too, by saying, “Oh yes!', 'She looked suspiciously\r\nat her sister; Maria’s countenance was to decide it: if she were vexed\r\nand alarmed—but Maria looked all serenity and satisfaction, and Julia\r\nwell knew that on this ground Maria could not be happy but at her\r\nexpense.', 'A short silence succeeded her leaving them; but her brother soon\r\nreturned to business and Lovers’ Vows, and was eagerly looking over the\r\nplay, with Mr. Yates’s help, to ascertain what scenery would be\r\nnecessary—while Maria and Henry Crawford conversed together in an\r\nunder-voice, and the declaration with which she began of, “I am sure I\r\nwould give up the part to Julia most willingly, but that though I shall\r\nprobably do it very ill, I feel persuaded _she_ would do it worse,” was\r\ndoubtless receiving all the compliments it called for.', 'Thus much was settled before Edmund, who had been out all the morning,\r\nknew anything of the matter; but when he entered the drawing-room\r\nbefore dinner, the buzz of discussion was high between Tom, Maria, and\r\nMr. Yates; and Mr. Rushworth stepped forward with great alacrity to\r\ntell him the agreeable news.', 'In a few minutes Mr. Bertram was called\r\nout of the room to satisfy some doubts of the carpenter; and being\r\naccompanied by Mr. Yates, and followed soon afterwards by Mr.\r\nRushworth, Edmund almost immediately took the opportunity of saying, “I\r\ncannot, before Mr. Yates, speak what I feel as to this play, without\r\nreflecting on his friends at Ecclesford; but I must now, my dear Maria,\r\ntell _you_, that I think it exceedingly unfit for private\r\nrepresentation, and that I hope you will give it up.', 'It will not be necessary to send you to your _father’s_\r\njudgment, I am convinced.”\r\n\r\n“We see things very differently,” cried Maria.', 'In all points of decorum _your_ conduct must be law to the rest of\r\nthe party.”\r\n\r\nThis picture of her consequence had some effect, for no one loved\r\nbetter to lead than Maria; and with far more good-humour she answered,\r\n“I am much obliged to you, Edmund; you mean very well, I am sure: but I\r\nstill think you see things too strongly; and I really cannot undertake\r\nto harangue all the rest upon a subject of this kind.', '“Sir Thomas\r\nwould not like it.—Fanny, ring the bell; I must have my dinner.—To be\r\nsure, Julia is dressed by this time.”\r\n\r\n“I am convinced, madam,” said Edmund, preventing Fanny, “that Sir\r\nThomas would not like it.”\r\n\r\n“There, my dear, do you hear what Edmund says?”\r\n\r\n“If I were to decline the part,” said Maria, with renewed zeal, “Julia\r\nwould certainly take it.”\r\n\r\n“What!” cried Edmund, “if she knew your reasons!”\r\n\r\n“Oh!', 'But the concerns of the theatre were suspended only for an hour or two:\r\nthere was still a great deal to be settled; and the spirits of evening\r\ngiving fresh courage, Tom, Maria, and Mr. Yates, soon after their being\r\nreassembled in the drawing-room, seated themselves in committee at a\r\nseparate table, with the play open before them, and were just getting\r\ndeep in the subject when a most welcome interruption was given by the\r\nentrance of Mr. and Miss Crawford, who, late and dark and dirty as it\r\nwas, could not help coming, and were received with the most grateful\r\njoy.', 'Her\r\nentreaty had no effect on Tom: he only said again what he had said\r\nbefore; and it was not merely Tom, for the requisition was now backed\r\nby Maria, and Mr. Crawford, and Mr. Yates, with an urgency which\r\ndiffered from his but in being more gentle or more ceremonious, and\r\nwhich altogether was quite overpowering to Fanny; and before she could\r\nbreathe after it, Mrs. Norris completed the whole by thus addressing\r\nher in a whisper at once angry and audible—“What a piece of work here\r\nis about nothing: I am quite ashamed of you, Fanny, to make such a\r\ndifficulty of obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort—so kind as\r\nthey are to you!', 'Tom Oliver is a very\r\nclever fellow, and Charles Maddox is as gentlemanlike a man as you will\r\nsee anywhere, so I will take my horse early to-morrow morning and ride\r\nover to Stoke, and settle with one of them.”\r\n\r\nWhile he spoke, Maria was looking apprehensively round at Edmund in\r\nfull expectation that he must oppose such an enlargement of the plan as\r\nthis: so contrary to all their first protestations; but Edmund said\r\nnothing.', 'Tom repeated his resolution of going\r\nto him early on the morrow; and though Julia, who had scarcely opened\r\nher lips before, observed, in a sarcastic manner, and with a glance\r\nfirst at Maria and then at Edmund, that “the Mansfield theatricals\r\nwould enliven the whole neighbourhood exceedingly,” Edmund still held\r\nhis peace, and shewed his feelings only by a determined gravity.', 'Miss Crawford had protected her only for the time; and\r\nif she were applied to again among themselves with all the\r\nauthoritative urgency that Tom and Maria were capable of, and Edmund\r\nperhaps away, what should she do?', 'The East room, as it had been called\r\never since Maria Bertram was sixteen, was now considered Fanny’s,\r\nalmost as decidedly as the white attic: the smallness of the one making\r\nthe use of the other so evidently reasonable that the Miss Bertrams,\r\nwith every superiority in their own apartments which their own sense of\r\nsuperiority could demand, were entirely approving it; and Mrs. Norris,\r\nhaving stipulated for there never being a fire in it on Fanny’s\r\naccount, was tolerably resigned to her having the use of what nobody\r\nelse wanted, though the terms in which she sometimes spoke of the\r\nindulgence seemed to imply that it was the best room in the house.', 'CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, a triumphant day to Mr. Bertram and Maria.', 'Henry Crawford had trifled with her feelings; but she had very long\r\nallowed and even sought his attentions, with a jealousy of her sister\r\nso reasonable as ought to have been their cure; and now that the\r\nconviction of his preference for Maria had been forced on her, she\r\nsubmitted to it without any alarm for Maria’s situation, or any\r\nendeavour at rational tranquillity for herself.', 'But, Mary, do not fancy that Maria Bertram cares for\r\nHenry.', 'I am sure _Julia_ does not, or she would not have flirted as she\r\ndid last night with Mr. Yates; and though he and Maria are very good\r\nfriends, I think she likes Sotherton too well to be inconstant.”\r\n\r\n“I would not give much for Mr. Rushworth’s chance if Henry stept in\r\nbefore the articles were signed.”\r\n\r\n“If you have such a suspicion, something must be done; and as soon as\r\nthe play is all over, we will talk to him seriously and make him know\r\nhis own mind; and if he means nothing, we will send him off, though he\r\nis Henry, for a time.”\r\n\r\nJulia _did_ suffer, however, though Mrs. Grant discerned it not, and\r\nthough it escaped the notice of many of her own family likewise.', 'The sister with whom she was used to be on easy\r\nterms was now become her greatest enemy: they were alienated from each\r\nother; and Julia was not superior to the hope of some distressing end\r\nto the attentions which were still carrying on there, some punishment\r\nto Maria for conduct so shameful towards herself as well as towards Mr.\r\nRushworth.', 'Maria felt her triumph, and pursued her purpose, careless\r\nof Julia; and Julia could never see Maria distinguished by Henry\r\nCrawford without trusting that it would create jealousy, and bring a\r\npublic disturbance at last.', 'She knew, also, that\r\npoor Mr. Rushworth could seldom get anybody to rehearse with him: _his_\r\ncomplaint came before her as well as the rest; and so decided to her\r\neye was her cousin Maria’s avoidance of him, and so needlessly often\r\nthe rehearsal of the first scene between her and Mr. Crawford, that she\r\nhad soon all the terror of other complaints from _him_.', '“And I do believe she can say every word of it,” added Maria, “for she\r\ncould put Mrs. Grant right the other day in twenty places.', '“It is time to think of our visitors,” said Maria, still feeling her\r\nhand pressed to Henry Crawford’s heart, and caring little for anything\r\nelse.', 'She took to herself all the\r\ncredit of bringing Mr. Rushworth’s admiration of Maria to any effect.', 'Sir Thomas soon\r\nappeared, and Maria saw with delight and agitation the introduction of\r\nthe man she loved to her father.', 'You will find nobody\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\n“It is about my uncle’s usual time.”\r\n\r\n“When do you think of going?”\r\n\r\n“I may, perhaps, get as far as Banbury to-day.”\r\n\r\n“Whose stables do you use at Bath?” was the next question; and while\r\nthis branch of the subject was under discussion, Maria, who wanted\r\nneither pride nor resolution, was preparing to encounter her share of\r\nit with tolerable calmness.', 'Henry Crawford was gone, gone from the house, and within two hours\r\nafterwards from the parish; and so ended all the hopes his selfish\r\nvanity had raised in Maria and Julia Bertram.', 'His presence was beginning to be\r\nodious to her; and if Maria gained him not, she was now cool enough to\r\ndispense with any other revenge.', 'I am sorry for them all, and would give\r\nsomething that Rushworth and Maria had never met.”\r\n\r\nIn this quarter, indeed, disappointment was impending over Sir Thomas.', 'He had expected a very different son-in-law; and beginning to feel\r\ngrave on Maria’s account, tried to understand _her_ feelings.', 'Mr.\r\nRushworth must and would improve in good society; and if Maria could\r\nnow speak so securely of her happiness with him, speaking certainly\r\nwithout the prejudice, the blindness of love, she ought to be believed.', 'Every public place was\r\nnew to Maria, and Brighton is almost as gay in winter as in summer.', 'Her two absent cousins, especially Maria, were much in her thoughts on\r\nseeing him; but no embarrassing remembrance affected _his_ spirits.', 'Well, I am much mistaken if his lovely Maria will ever\r\nwant him to make two-and-forty speeches to her”; adding, with a\r\nmomentary seriousness, “She is too good for him—much too good.” And\r\nthen changing his tone again to one of gentle gallantry, and addressing\r\nFanny, he said, “You were Mr. Rushworth’s best friend.', 'I wish they would stay at home.”\r\n\r\nThis wish was levelled principally at Julia, who had just applied for\r\npermission to go to town with Maria; and as Sir Thomas thought it best\r\nfor each daughter that the permission should be granted, Lady Bertram,\r\nthough in her own good-nature she would not have prevented it, was\r\nlamenting the change it made in the prospect of Julia’s return, which\r\nwould otherwise have taken place about this time.', 'Maria and Julia, and especially Maria, were so\r\nclosely implicated in Mr. Crawford’s misconduct, that she could not\r\ngive his character, such as she believed it, without betraying them.', 'Maria\r\nis nobly married; but had Mr. Crawford sought Julia’s hand, I should\r\nhave given it to him with superior and more heartfelt satisfaction than\r\nI gave Maria’s to Mr. Rushworth.” After half a moment’s pause: “And I\r\nshould have been very much surprised had either of my daughters, on\r\nreceiving a proposal of marriage at any time which might carry with it\r\nonly _half_ the eligibility of _this_, immediately and peremptorily,\r\nand without paying my opinion or my regard the compliment of any\r\nconsultation, put a decided negative on it.', 'Mr. Crawford was no longer the Mr. Crawford who, as\r\nthe clandestine, insidious, treacherous admirer of Maria Bertram, had\r\nbeen her abhorrence, whom she had hated to see or to speak to, in whom\r\nshe could believe no good quality to exist, and whose power, even of\r\nbeing agreeable, she had barely acknowledged.', 'I shall tell Sir Thomas that I am sure it was done that\r\nevening.” And still pursuing the same cheerful thoughts, she soon\r\nafterwards added, “And I will tell you what, Fanny, which is more than\r\nI did for Maria: the next time Pug has a litter you shall have a\r\npuppy.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nEdmund had great things to hear on his return.', 'I then saw him behaving, as it appeared\r\nto me, so very improperly and unfeelingly—I may speak of it now because\r\nit is all over—so improperly by poor Mr. Rushworth, not seeming to care\r\nhow he exposed or hurt him, and paying attentions to my cousin Maria,\r\nwhich—in short, at the time of the play, I received an impression which\r\nwill never be got over.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Fanny,” replied Edmund, scarcely hearing her to the end, “let\r\nus not, any of us, be judged by what we appeared at that period of\r\ngeneral folly.', 'I am shocked whenever I think that Maria could be\r\ncapable of it; but, if she could undertake the part, we must not be\r\nsurprised at the rest.”\r\n\r\n“Before the play, I am much mistaken if _Julia_ did not think he was\r\npaying her attentions.”\r\n\r\n“Julia!', 'You\r\nwill wish to hear my opinion of Maria’s degree of comfort as a wife.', 'Mrs. Norris, however, as most attached to Maria, was\r\nreally the greatest sufferer.', 'Mr. Rushworth\r\nhad been gone at this time to Bath, to pass a few days with his mother,\r\nand bring her back to town, and Maria was with these friends without\r\nany restraint, without even Julia; for Julia had removed from Wimpole\r\nStreet two or three weeks before, on a visit to some relations of Sir\r\nThomas; a removal which her father and mother were now disposed to\r\nattribute to some view of convenience on Mr. Yates’s account.', 'He called it a bad thing,\r\ndone in the worst manner, and at the worst time; and though Julia was\r\nyet as more pardonable than Maria as folly than vice, he could not but\r\nregard the step she had taken as opening the worst probabilities of a\r\nconclusion hereafter like her sister’s.', 'She reprobated her brother’s folly in being drawn on by a woman\r\nwhom he had never cared for, to do what must lose him the woman he\r\nadored; but still more the folly of poor Maria, in sacrificing such a\r\nsituation, plunging into such difficulties, under the idea of being\r\nreally loved by a man who had long ago made his indifference clear.', 'Too late he became aware how unfavourable to the character of any young\r\npeople must be the totally opposite treatment which Maria and Julia had\r\nbeen always experiencing at home, where the excessive indulgence and\r\nflattery of their aunt had been continually contrasted with his own\r\nseverity.', 'It ended in Mrs. Norris’s resolving to quit Mansfield and devote\r\nherself to her unfortunate Maria, and in an establishment being formed\r\nfor them in another country, remote and private, where, shut up\r\ntogether with little society, on one side no affection, on the other no\r\njudgment, it may be reasonably supposed that their tempers became their\r\nmutual punishment.', 'That Julia escaped better than Maria was owing, in some measure, to a\r\nfavourable difference of disposition and circumstance, but in a greater\r\nto her having been less the darling of that very aunt, less flattered\r\nand less spoilt.', 'He saw Mrs. Rushworth,\r\nwas received by her with a coldness which ought to have been repulsive,\r\nand have established apparent indifference between them for ever; but\r\nhe was mortified, he could not bear to be thrown off by the woman whose\r\nsmiles had been so wholly at his command: he must exert himself to\r\nsubdue so proud a display of resentment; it was anger on Fanny’s\r\naccount; he must get the better of it, and make Mrs. Rushworth Maria\r\nBertram again in her treatment of himself.']

• La frase più lunga per il nome ' Katerina Ivanovna ' é:
Sonia flushed crimson, and Katerina Ivanovna
suddenly burst into tears, immediately observing that she was “nervous
and silly, that she was too much upset, that it was time to finish, and
as the dinner was over, it was time to hand round the tea.”

At that moment, Amalia Ivanovna, deeply aggrieved at taking no part in
the conversation, and not being listened to, made one last effort,
and with secret misgivings ventured on an exceedingly deep and weighty
observation, that “in the future boarding-school she would have to pay
particular attention to _die Wäsche_, and that there certainly must be a
good _dame_ to look after the linen, and secondly that the young ladies
must not novels at night read.”

Katerina Ivanovna, who certainly was upset and very tired, as well as
heartily sick of the dinner, at once cut short Amalia Ivanovna, saying
“she knew nothing about it and was talking nonsense, that it was the
business of the laundry maid, and not of the directress of a high-class
boarding-school to look after _die Wäsche_, and as for novel-reading,
that was simply rudeness, and she begged her to be silent.” Amalia
Ivanovna fired up and getting angry observed that she only “meant her
good,” and that “she had meant her very good,” and that “it was long
since she had paid her _gold_ for the lodgings.”

Katerina Ivanovna at once “set her down,” saying that it was a lie to
say she wished her good, because only yesterday when her dead husband
was lying on the table, she had worried her about the lodgings.


• La frase più lunga per il nome ' Sonia ' é:
She did not utter a word, she did not even look at her, she
simply picked up our big green _drap de dames_ shawl (we have a shawl,
made of _drap de dames_), put it over her head and face and lay down
on the bed with her face to the wall; only her little shoulders and her
body kept shuddering.... And I went on lying there, just as before....
And then I saw, young man, I saw Katerina Ivanovna, in the same silence
go up to Sonia’s little bed; she was on her knees all the evening
kissing Sonia’s feet, and would not get up, and then they both fell
asleep in each other’s arms... together, together... yes... and I... lay
drunk.”

Marmeladov stopped short, as though his voice had failed him.


• La frase più lunga per il nome ' Svidrigaïlov ' é:
At
their last meeting Svidrigaïlov informed Raskolnikov that he had made
an arrangement, and a very satisfactory one, for Katerina Ivanovna’s
children; that he had, through certain connections, succeeded in getting
hold of certain personages by whose help the three orphans could be at
once placed in very suitable institutions; that the money he had settled
on them had been of great assistance, as it is much easier to place
orphans with some property than destitute ones.


• La frase più lunga per il nome ' Pyotr Petrovitch ' é:
Inquiring of Madame Lippevechsel who was busy
laying the table while Katerina Ivanovna was away at the cemetery, he
heard that the entertainment was to be a great affair, that all the
lodgers had been invited, among them some who had not known the dead
man, that even Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov was invited in spite of
his previous quarrel with Katerina Ivanovna, that he, Pyotr Petrovitch,
was not only invited, but was eagerly expected as he was the most
important of the lodgers.


• La frase più lunga per il nome ' Avdotya Romanovna ' é:
When I was there he behaved well to the servants, and they
were actually fond of him, though they certainly did blame him for
Philip’s death.”

“I perceive, Avdotya Romanovna, that you seem disposed to undertake his
defence all of a sudden,” Luzhin observed, twisting his lips into
an ambiguous smile, “there’s no doubt that he is an astute man, and
insinuating where ladies are concerned, of which Marfa Petrovna, who has
died so strangely, is a terrible instance.


• La frase più lunga per il nome ' Dounia ' é:
Nor
has either Dounia or I breathed a word to him of the great hopes we have
of his helping us to pay for your university studies; we have not spoken
of it in the first place, because it will come to pass of itself,
later on, and he will no doubt without wasting words offer to do it of
himself, (as though he could refuse Dounia that) the more readily since
you may by your own efforts become his right hand in the office, and
receive this assistance not as a charity, but as a salary earned by your
own work.


• La frase più lunga per il nome ' Rodya ' é:
Pashenka would never have
thought of doing anything on her own account, she is too retiring; but
the business man is by no means retiring, and first thing he puts the
question, ‘Is there any hope of realising the I O U?’ Answer: there is,
because he has a mother who would save her Rodya with her hundred and
twenty-five roubles pension, if she has to starve herself; and a sister,
too, who would go into bondage for his sake.


• La frase più lunga per il nome ' Pulcheria Alexandrovna ' é:
On Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s anxiously and timidly inquiring as
to “some suspicion of insanity,” he replied with a composed and candid
smile that his words had been exaggerated; that certainly the patient
had some fixed idea, something approaching a monomania--he, Zossimov,
was now particularly studying this interesting branch of medicine--but
that it must be recollected that until to-day the patient had been in
delirium and... and that no doubt the presence of his family would have
a favourable effect on his recovery and distract his mind, “if only all
fresh shocks can be avoided,” he added significantly.

• La frase più lunga per il nome ' Fanny ' é:
And I do not know that I should be fond of
preaching often; now and then, perhaps once or twice in the spring,
after being anxiously expected for half a dozen Sundays together; but
not for a constancy; it would not do for a constancy.”

Here Fanny, who could not but listen, involuntarily shook her head, and
Crawford was instantly by her side again, entreating to know her
meaning; and as Edmund perceived, by his drawing in a chair, and
sitting down close by her, that it was to be a very thorough attack,
that looks and undertones were to be well tried, he sank as quietly as
possible into a corner, turned his back, and took up a newspaper, very
sincerely wishing that dear little Fanny might be persuaded into
explaining away that shake of the head to the satisfaction of her
ardent lover; and as earnestly trying to bury every sound of the
business from himself in murmurs of his own, over the various
advertisements of “A most desirable Estate in South Wales”; “To Parents
and Guardians”; and a “Capital season’d Hunter.”

Fanny, meanwhile, vexed with herself for not having been as motionless
as she was speechless, and grieved to the heart to see Edmund’s
arrangements, was trying by everything in the power of her modest,
gentle nature, to repulse Mr. Crawford, and avoid both his looks and
inquiries; and he, unrepulsable, was persisting in both.

• La frase più lunga per il nome ' Sir Thomas ' é:
I do not exactly
know the distance, but when you get back to Portsmouth, if it is not
very far off, you ought to go over and pay your respects to them; and I
could send a little parcel by you that I want to get conveyed to your
cousins.”

“I should be very happy, aunt; but Brighton is almost by Beachey Head;
and if I could get so far, I could not expect to be welcome in such a
smart place as that—poor scrubby midshipman as I am.”

Mrs. Norris was beginning an eager assurance of the affability he might
depend on, when she was stopped by Sir Thomas’s saying with authority,
“I do not advise your going to Brighton, William, as I trust you may
soon have more convenient opportunities of meeting; but my daughters
would be happy to see their cousins anywhere; and you will find Mr.
Rushworth most sincerely disposed to regard all the connexions of our
family as his own.”

“I would rather find him private secretary to the First Lord than
anything else,” was William’s only answer, in an undervoice, not meant
to reach far, and the subject dropped.


• La frase più lunga per il nome ' Miss Crawford ' é:
It must make him think;
and I have no doubt that he oftener endeavours to restrain himself than
he would if he had been anything but a clergyman.”

“We cannot prove to the contrary, to be sure; but I wish you a better
fate, Miss Price, than to be the wife of a man whose amiableness
depends upon his own sermons; for though he may preach himself into a
good-humour every Sunday, it will be bad enough to have him quarrelling
about green geese from Monday morning till Saturday night.”

“I think the man who could often quarrel with Fanny,” said Edmund
affectionately, “must be beyond the reach of any sermons.”

Fanny turned farther into the window; and Miss Crawford had only time
to say, in a pleasant manner, “I fancy Miss Price has been more used to
deserve praise than to hear it”; when, being earnestly invited by the
Miss Bertrams to join in a glee, she tripped off to the instrument,
leaving Edmund looking after her in an ecstasy of admiration of all her
many virtues, from her obliging manners down to her light and graceful
tread.

very far off, you ought to go over and pay your respects to them; and I
could send a little parcel by you that I want to get conveyed to your

• La frase più lunga per il nome ' Lady Bertram ' é:
I know nothing about it, but Fanny must teach
me.”

Here Fanny interposed, however, with anxious protestations of her own
equal ignorance; she had never played the game nor seen it played in
her life; and Lady Bertram felt a moment’s indecision again; but upon
everybody’s assuring her that nothing could be so easy, that it was the
easiest game on the cards, and Henry Crawford’s stepping forward with a
most earnest request to be allowed to sit between her ladyship and Miss
Price, and teach them both, it was so settled; and Sir Thomas, Mrs.
Norris, and Dr. and Mrs. Grant being seated at the table of prime
intellectual state and dignity, the remaining six, under Miss
Crawford’s direction, were arranged round the other.


• La frase più lunga per il nome ' Mr. Rushworth ' é:
Instead of envying Mr.
Rushworth, you should assist him with your opinion.”

Mrs. Grant, hearing the latter part of this speech, enforced it warmly,
persuaded that no judgment could be equal to her brother’s; and as Miss
Bertram caught at the idea likewise, and gave it her full support,
declaring that, in her opinion, it was infinitely better to consult
with friends and disinterested advisers, than immediately to throw the
business into the hands of a professional man, Mr. Rushworth was very
ready to request the favour of Mr. Crawford’s assistance; and Mr.
Crawford, after properly depreciating his own abilities, was quite at
his service in any way that could be useful.


• La frase più lunga per il nome ' Norris ' é:
Excepting the moments of peculiar delight, which any marked or
unlooked-for instance of Edmund’s consideration of her in the last few
months had excited, Fanny had never known so much felicity in her life,
as in this unchecked, equal, fearless intercourse with the brother and
friend who was opening all his heart to her, telling her all his hopes
and fears, plans, and solicitudes respecting that long thought of,
dearly earned, and justly valued blessing of promotion; who could give
her direct and minute information of the father and mother, brothers
and sisters, of whom she very seldom heard; who was interested in all
the comforts and all the little hardships of her home at Mansfield;
ready to think of every member of that home as she directed, or
differing only by a less scrupulous opinion, and more noisy abuse of
their aunt Norris, and with whom (perhaps the dearest indulgence of the
whole) all the evil and good of their earliest years could be gone over
again, and every former united pain and pleasure retraced with the
fondest recollection.


• La frase più lunga per il nome ' Maria ' é:
When Edmund, therefore, told her in
reply, as he did when she would give him the hearing, that she need not
distress herself on Mrs. Rushworth’s account, because he had taken the
opportunity, as he walked with her through the hall, of mentioning Miss
Price as one who would probably be of the party, and had directly
received a very sufficient invitation for his cousin, Mrs. Norris was
too much vexed to submit with a very good grace, and would only say,
“Very well, very well, just as you chuse, settle it your own way, I am
sure I do not care about it.”

“It seems very odd,” said Maria, “that you should be staying at home
instead of Fanny.”

“I am sure she ought to be very much obliged to you,” added Julia,
hastily leaving the room as she spoke, from a consciousness that she
ought to offer to stay at home herself.
